0,Cartel Gunmen Ambush Border Police with Armored Trucks,2016-10-15,"REYNOSA, Tamaulipas  —   Cartel gunmen riding in armored SUVs ambushed a state police convoy killing one of the officers and sparking a series of chases and gun battles over a period of hours. [The ambush against the state police officers comes after citizen journalists in the border region known as the Ribereña or riverine have reported on gun battles involving large convoys of gunmen. According to residents, the gun battles among cartel factions started early morning in the area immediately south of Roma, Texas and quickly spread to other rural communities. The Ribereña is immediately south of Starr County, Texas and is considered a major drug trafficking route due to the lack of border security in the area.   Law enforcement sources consulted by Breitbart Texas revealed that the ambush took place about four hours after the initial gun battles in the Rancherias rural community near the city of Camargo, which is immediately south of Rio Grande City, Texas. A convoy of armored cartel trucks attacked police forces, setting off a fierce gun battle where one of the officers died. At the end of the clash, two cartel vehicles were left behind. One of the vehicles was a standard SUV, while the other truck was armored. Both vehicles had extensive damage from collisions and gunshots.  A second clash took place shortly after as Mexican military personnel rushed to assist the state police officers. Along the way, the soldiers fought with some cartel gunmen resulting in another skirmish. Authorities have not disclosed the number of attackers that were injured or killed during the fighting.  Cartel fighters threw hundreds of   road spikes and used stolen cars to block the main highways in an effort to slow down police. The violence resulted in chaos for regular citizens as several reported getting flat tires or being stuck in the traffic jams caused by the blockades.  The attacks against police forces appear to have spiked in recent days with cartel forces focusing on state agents, particularly in the Ribereña area. The move appears to be a backlash at the increase in operations targeting cartel activity. Recently deployed convoys of Mexican marines have been completing successful raids against gunmen. On Wednesday, Mexican marines seized several armored trucks used by the Gulf Cartel. Editor’s Note: Breitbart Texas traveled to the Mexican States of Tamaulipas, Coahuila and Nuevo León to recruit citizen journalists willing to risk their lives and expose the cartels silencing their communities.  The writers would face certain death at the hands of the various cartels that operate in those areas including the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas if a pseudonym were not used. Breitbart Texas’ Cartel Chronicles are published in both English and in their original Spanish. This article was written by “A. C. Del Angel” from Reynosa, Tamaulipas. "
1,Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton Struggle to Be Unifying Voice for Nation - The New York Times,2017-01-21,"No moment in the 2016 presidential campaign has cried out more for a unifying candidate than the police shootings of two black men last week and the ensuing national uproar, followed by the shocking sniper ambush that killed five police officers in Dallas. And no other moment has revealed more starkly how hard it is for Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton to become that candidate. Never have two presidential nominees been as unpopular as Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton, and they are not fully trusted by their own parties nor showing significant crossover appeal in the polls. Mr. Trump, the   champion of law and order, is also the political figure many people blame for sowing division and hatred with his attacks on illegal immigrants, Muslims, Mexicans and others. Rather than defuse tension, he electrifies crowds and vanquishes rivals through provocations that he delights in calling politically incorrect. Of the two, Mrs. Clinton would seem more able, and driven, to try to bring the country together. She has a large following among black voters and speaks ardently about the need for “respect” and “love and kindness. ” After Dallas, she called on “white people to understand how   feel every day. ” Yet many on the right and some on the left dislike her intensely, and even her admirers say she lacks the public emotion, oratorical skills and reputation for honesty to persuade large numbers of Americans to see things her way. The need for a reassuring and healing voice has come at a particularly bad time for the two presumptive presidential nominees. For many Americans, Mrs. Clinton’s credibility was further damaged last week as the F. B. I. director, James B. Comey, sharply criticized her for being “extremely careless” about her use of private email as secretary of state. At the same time, Mr. Trump alienated many voters with his mixed comments about Saddam Hussein and his defensiveness over a Twitter post that many people regarded as  . “Trump is 100 percent saying the right things about police and respecting authority, but then he says these other comments that are too weird for voters to ignore,” said Fred L. DeLuca, a Trump supporter and former police officer who owns a graphic supply store in Youngstown, Ohio. “And Hillary  —   I don’t trust what she says about law enforcement, not at all. ” Traumatic events have at times become opportunities for presidential candidates to step up and grow in the eyes of the American public, such as when Bill Clinton went to Los Angeles in 1992 in the aftermath of the riots there, or when Barack Obama pushed for aggressive, bipartisan action from the federal government to stem the banking crisis and protect taxpayers. Mr. Clinton’s   image and empathic personality appealed across party lines, as did Mr. Obama’s historic candidacy. And in moments of national crisis, presidents have shown ability to unify the country, if fleetingly, like George W. Bush did after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. These candidates did not have to sell themselves to voters against such an intense combination of terrorism, mass shootings, police and gun violence, social unease and   fear. Still, the current run of crises has, in the view of many Democrats and Republicans, served only to spotlight the shortcomings of both Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton. “The sense of alienation and estrangement is so great today that it’s hard to unite people, and these candidates haven’t done it,” said the Rev. Jesse Jackson, a Clinton backer. The historian Doris Kearns Goodwin compared the current political climate to the Civil War era and recalled Lincoln’s “House Divided” speech, during his 1858 Senate campaign, in which he analyzed the deep divisions between the North and the South and predicted that the country would become more united  —   but first slavery had to be eliminated or made the law of the land. She said Lincoln proved to be a president who would go to war to unify the country, and credited President Lyndon B. Johnson and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. with mobilizing forces around the country and in Congress in the 1960s to pass civil rights legislation that  —   while highly divisive  —   also brought greater equality for Americans. “If Trump was a more disciplined, focused candidate, this could be his moment to win over Americans because the desire for a strong leader is great in moments of turbulence,” she said. “But look at his record. After ‘Brexit,’ he talked about the weak currency helping his golf course. After the Orlando shootings, it was, ‘I told you so.’ After the F. B. I. report on Hillary, he couldn’t focus on that. Voters want candidates to show we can trust them, and both candidates have this problem. ” In several recent polls, roughly   of Americans said that Mrs. Clinton was not honest and trustworthy Mr. Trump drew similar numbers on the question. These polls were conducted before the F. B. I. director rebuked Mrs. Clinton over her private email and handling of classified material. Mr. Trump, whose poll ratings grew after his forceful responses to terrorist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, Calif. tried to sound similarly resolute on Friday evening, saying in a video that law enforcement was “the force between civilization and total chaos. ” And, he said, “Now is the time for prayers, love, unity and leadership. ” These remarks were relatively restrained for him, and his advisers hope that he can build on his image as a powerful,   executive and attempt to unify voters. He is the choice of most voters who say they are particularly interested in electing a strong leader  —   a little over   of the electorate, according to a recent Bloomberg Politics survey. A Gallup poll conducted in May showed that six in 10 Americans consider him a strong and decisive leader. Vernita Blocker, a retired social work administrator from Lindenwold, N. J. supports Mrs. Clinton but said she worried that Mr. Trump might be better suited to capitalize on Americans’ concerns about fraying social order. “The more people are afraid, the more it plays into Trump’s hands because they will want a   president,” Ms. Blocker said. “Hillary has to find more ways to persuade people that she could really unite the country despite all the people who don’t like her. ” Yet Mr. Trump is still having trouble uniting his own party, while Mrs. Clinton appears further along with Democrats. The conventions this month will be huge opportunities for the nominees to galvanize the faithful, but also a chance to reach out to the other side with traditionally positive speeches about their hopes for the country. On policy, Mrs. Clinton is also eager to find common ground on gun control and criminal justice reform  —   issues that resonate with many voters at a time of seemingly endless violence. While new gun laws are opposed by many on the right, she wants Americans to at least talk about finding solutions  —   if not uniting behind them. “I think ‘unity’ is the wrong goal, and what we need can’t be achieved by lofty oratory alone,” said Wendy L. Wall, an associate professor of history at Binghamton University. “Often in our past, unity has meant burying disagreements rather than solving common problems. What we need now is someone who can work across differences, not erase them. ” “I think there is no way Trump could do this,” she added. “I think the jury is still out on Clinton. ”"

3,Trump to world leaders: Why don’t you call me on my cellphone,2017-05-31,"’  ’ ”   WASHINGTON (AP)  —   President Donald Trump has been handing out his   cellphone number to world leaders and urging them to call him   directly, an unusual invitation that breaks diplomatic protocol   and is raising concerns about the security and secrecy of the   U. S. commander in chief’s communications. ” ’   Trump has urged leaders of Canada and Mexico to reach him on his   cellphone, according to former and current U. S. officials with   direct knowledge of the practice. Of the two, only Canadian Prime   Minister Justin Trudeau has taken advantage of the offer so far,   the officials said. ’ ”   Trump also exchanged numbers with French President Emmanuel   Macron when the two spoke immediately following Macron’s victory   earlier this month, according to a French official, who would not   comment on whether Macron intended to use the line. ” ”   All the officials demanded anonymity because they were not   authorized to reveal the conversations. Neither the White House   nor Trudeau’s office responded to requests for comment. ” ’   The notion of world leaders calling each other up via cellphone   may seem unremarkable in the modern, mobile world. But in the   diplomatic arena, where    calls are highly   orchestrated affairs, it is another notable breach of protocol   for a president who has expressed distrust of official channels.   The formalities and discipline of diplomacy have been a rough fit   for Trump  —   who, before taking office, was long easily accessible   by cellphone and viewed himself as freewheeling, impulsive   dealmaker. ’ ’’ ’   Presidents generally place calls on one of several secure phone   lines, including those in the White House Situation Room, the   Oval Office or the presidential limousine. Even if Trump uses his     cellphone, his calls are vulnerable to   eavesdropping, particularly from foreign governments, national   security experts say. ’ ’   ”If you are speaking on an open line, then it’’s an open line,   meaning those who have the ability to monitor those conversations   are doing so,” said Derek Chollet, a former Pentagon adviser and   National Security Council official now at the German Marshall   Fund of the United States. ’ ’   A president ”doesn’’t carry with him a secure phone,” Chollet   said. ”If someone is trying to spy on you, then everything you’’re   saying, you have to presume that others are listening to it.” ’ ”   The caution is warranted even when dealing with allies. As German   Chancellor Angela Merkel’s learned in 2013, when a dump of   American secrets leaked by Edward Snowden revealed the U. S. was   monitoring her cellphone, good relations don’t prevent some   spycraft between friends. ” ’   ”If you are Macron or the leader of any country and you get the   cellphone number of the president of the United States, it’’s   reasonable to assume that they’’d hand it right over to their   intel service,” said Ashley Deeks, a law professor at the   University of Virginia who formerly served as the assistant legal   adviser for   affairs in the U. S. State   Department. ’ ”   The practice opens Trump up to charges of hypocrisy. Throughout   last year’s presidential campaign, he lambasted Democratic rival   Hillary Clinton for using a private email server while she was   secretary of state, insisting she should not be given access to   classified information because she would leave it vulnerable to   foreign foes. ” ”   Presidents’ phone calls with world leaders often involve   considerable advance planning. State Department and National   Security Council officials typically prepare scripted talking   points and background on the leader on the other end of the line.   Often an informal transcript of the call is made and circulated   among a select group  —   sometimes a small clutch of aides,   sometimes a broader group of foreign policy officials. Those   records are preserved and archived. ” ’   The White House did not respond to questions on whether the   president is keeping records of any   calls with world   leaders. ’ ”   Trump’s White House is already facing scrutiny for apparent   efforts to work outside usual diplomatic channels. ” ”   The administration has been fending off questions about a senior   aide’s attempt to set up a secret back channel of communication   with Moscow in the weeks before Trump was took office. White   House adviser Jared Kushner, Trump’s    met in December   with Russia’s ambassador to the U. S. and discussed whether a   secret line of communication could be used to facilitate   sensitive policy discussions about the conflict in Syria,   according to a person familiar with the talks. The person   demanded anonymity because the person was not authorized to   discuss the sensitive conversation by name. ” ’   The White House has said such back channel communications are   useful and discreet. ’ ’   Trump has struggled more than most recent presidents to keep his   conversations with world leaders private. His remarks to   Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, Mexican President   Enrique Pena Nieto and Russian diplomats have all leaked,   presumably after notes of the conversations were circulated by   national security officials. ’ ’   It was unclear whether an impromptu, informal call with a foreign   leader would be logged and archived. The Presidential Records Act   of 1981, passed in response to the Watergate scandal, requires   that the president and his staff preserve all records related to   the office. In 2014, the act was amended to include personal   emails. ’ ’   But the law contains ”blind spots”  —   namely,   for   direct cellphone communications, said Jonathan Turley, a   professor at George Washington University Law School, who   specializes in public interest and national security law. ’ ”   Under Barack Obama, the first   president, worries   about cyber intrusions  —   particularly by foreign governments  —     pulled the president’s devices deep into the security bubble.   Many of the functions on Obama’s BlackBerry were blocked, and a   very small handful of people had his phone number or email   address, according to former aides. ” ’   ”Government sometimes looks like a big bureaucracy that has   stupid rules, but a lot of these things are in place for very   good reasons and they’’ve been around for a while and determine   the most effective way to do business in the foreign policy   sphere,” said Deeks. ”Sometimes it takes presidents longer to   figure that out.” ’ ’WASHINGTON (AP)  —   President Donald Trump. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’"
4,Facebook Reportedly Complies With Pakistan’s Demand to Censor ’Blasphemy’ as Call to Hang Blasphemer Trends on Twitter - Breitbart,2017-03-28,"The Islamic Republic of Pakistan has launched a crackdown against   “blasphemy” on social media, and Facebook and Twitter are doing little to stop it. According to government sources, Facebook is even assisting Pakistan in removing “blasphemous” content. [Late last week, government officials in Pakistan informed the Islamabad High Court that “almost 85 percent” of “blasphemous” material on Facebook had been taken down at the request of the government.  Facebook has yet to publicly confirm or deny this claim from the Pakistani government. However, earlier this month, Facebook  —   which claims to be “founded” on “principles of free expression,” dispatched a delegation to Pakistan to address the government’s demand for religious censorship. At the time of writing, Facebook did not reply to an inquiry from Breitbart News asking the company if they had removed “blasphemous” material to satisfy Pakistan. Pakistan, a   country which once harboured Al Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden within its borders, recently launched a crackdown on social media blasphemy. The country’s Prime Minister, Nawaz Sharif has ordered authorities to take urgent steps to remove blasphemous content on social media and apprehend those who post it. Last week, three Pakistani bloggers were arrested on suspicion of blasphemy, and had their laptops seized. If convicted, they could face the death penalty. Pakistan wants social media companies to help identify anonymous posters of blapshemous content, and has announced that it will seek the extradition of any Pakistanis who post blasphemous content from abroad. International affairs magazine The Diplomat has branded the   crackdown a “war on atheism. ” Meanwhile, on Twitter, a hashtag calling for the execution of one of the arrested “blapshemers,” ‘#HangAyazNizami,’ trended in Pakistan as Muslim users took to the platform to call for the blood of heretics.  Fuck with freedom of speech hang this fucker asap. 😏 #HangAyazNizami,  —   Sardar Waqar (@Engrr_vicky) March 25, 2017,  Call us terrorist or extremist or what everbut he must be hanged #hangayaznizami,  —   Daniyal Ahmed (@daniyalaahmed) March 25, 2017,  He must be drag in the streets then hanged #HangAyazNizami,  —   Nida Ahmed (@nidaa214) March 25, 2017,  Western Twitter users reacted strongly against the trend.

5,"Poor, Displaced and Anxious in North Carolina as Floods Climb After Hurricane - The New York Times",2017-03-15,"KINSTON, N. C.  —   At a community college turned hurricane shelter, Frednesa Pope, 37, wondered on Wednesday if the floodwaters from Hurricane Matthew, which are expected to crest here on Friday, would force her and her family out of an apartment they could barely afford. This week, Gregory   58, who lives on a fixed income and was taking shelter from the flooding in Fair Bluff, N. C. to the southwest, knew that the truck he had just bought was flooded. And over the weekend, Ethel and Austin Chavis of Lumberton, N. C. ripped the carpets out of their flooded home and wondered how much it would cost to make things right again and where they would find the money. “We’ve got to find some assistance,” Ms. Chavis, 66, said as she looked at the floorboards buckling around her, “because we definitely need it. ” Hurricane Matthew spawned ferocious wind and rain across North Carolina, dumping more than a foot of water in parts of the state and touching off a creeping disaster that had killed 22 people in the state by Thursday. Day after day, in town after town, swollen rivers have transformed thoroughfares into canals and homes into sodden islands, in some cases with only the roof or the windows peeking above the water. And the water has risen in some of the state’s poorest areas, upending the lives of many already living on the financial edge. “The poorest of the poor in North Carolina are the ones who are being hurt the most by these floods,” Gov. Pat McCrory said at an otherwise upbeat news conference on Thursday. “These people have nothing,” he added, urging people to donate to a state disaster fund. By Thursday, $2. 6 million in aid from the Federal Emergency Management Agency had been disbursed and 14, 000 people had applied for aid. Individual assistance from FEMA, which has averaged about $2, 000 a family in recent years, is designed to help with immediate needs  —   like temporary rental housing, repairs not covered by insurance, and the replacement of critical personal items  —   but those grants are somewhat limited. “It’s not designed to make survivors whole again,” said Rafael Lemaitre, a spokesman for the agency. “It’s more of a life vest, rather than a lifeboat. ” Mr. McCrory’s administration said that disaster unemployment assistance, which can cover wages lost because of a storm, would be available in 20 counties. But even when state and federal officials work to disburse flood aid, experts said, it is often harder for families living on the margins to bounce back. The Food Bank of Central and Eastern North Carolina estimated that 356, 000 people in the 21 counties it was monitoring for storm and flood effects did not have access to enough healthy food, even before the floods. Floodwaters have left downtown Lumberton, a city where a third of residents live in poverty, underwater. They crested at more than a foot above the record on Tuesday in Goldsboro, N. C. where the poverty rate is 25 percent. And in Kinston, residents waited in shelters for the Neuse River to crest on Friday. “Sometimes, you just have to think that God is piling on with these storms,” said Gene Nichol, a law professor at the University of North Carolina who researches poverty. Poverty in the region, he said, goes back to the time of slavery, but he added that the state’s   Legislature had further eroded the social safety net by winnowing unemployment benefits, cutting the state’s   tax credit and largely refusing to expand Medicaid. “There are challenging legacies,” Professor Nichol said. “The want of investment and opportunity in eastern North Carolina is made only more difficult by tragedies like this. ” Some natural disasters, like tornadoes, seem genuinely indiscriminate, as likely to damage wealthy neighborhoods as to damage poor ones. But in Kinston, the pain from the floods  —   which were preceded by days of warning  —   seem to a certain extent linked to economics. Those with cars have been able to take their valuables, or even their furniture, and leave town for hotel rooms or to stay with family. Those who earn more are more likely to have paid time off, and to have savings to cushion the financial blow from a storm. And floods often play out in   areas where the residents are disproportionately poor. The shelter here at Lenoir Community College, which by Thursday had become a temporary home for about 200 people, was full of residents with no money to spare  —   even among those working full time  —   and a sense of dread as the water rose. Ms. Pope, a cabinet sprayer in a local plant, evacuated her home in Kinston this week when fire officials told her it was almost certain to flood when the river crested. “I put my clothes up as high as I could,” she said. “I don’t have a car I wasn’t able to get a   like everyone else in the neighborhood. I live from paycheck to paycheck. ” Ms. Pope’s apartment had flooded during the devastation from Hurricane Floyd in 1999, and her landlord had told her it was unlikely to withstand a second event that forecasters said could be even worse. “I’ll have to start all the way back over,” said Ms. Pope, who already pays her $400 rent in two installments so she can pay the bills in the middle of the month. “Everything in there, it’s paid for. If it floods, I’m through. ” Wesley Turner, 71, a Vietnam veteran who retired from a rubber stopper plant in town, said his home seemed close to flooding even before the river’s crest. “I worked for years and years to make money for a   which I thought would be home for the rest of my life,” Mr. Turner said. “I can’t afford another trailer. I can’t afford a pup tent. ” Inside the shelter, LaVonda Hamilton, 42, was wondering whether she would need to take on a     loan to make ends meet. She had been unable to get to her job as an account specialist at an outsourcing firm near the coast for a week. “I have two kids, you know, in high school,” Ms. Hamilton said. “It sets you back. ” And in Lumberton, where floodwaters were just beginning to recede, Billie Thompson, 36, returned to her home to take stock of what she had lost  —   “It’s in a shamble right now,” she said  —   and scrambled to get to her job at the Butterball factory for the first time since last week. A single mother, Ms. Thompson tried to figure out how to replace ruined items, like school clothes that she bought in August for her daughter. “My daughter has started planning a birthday party next month I might have to cancel that,” Ms. Thompson said, adding, “She needs clothes more than she needs the party. ”"
6,"Building homes, inspiring hope in Mexico",2017-03-20," (CNN) Many families in Mexico migrate to the country’s Baja region on the West Coast seeking jobs and better lives. Though they find employment, they often join the ranks of Mexico’s ”working poor,” barely earning the equivalent of $100 a week.  Their homes are piecemeal, built out of scrap parts  —   some missing a roof and lacking electricity. These families want better homes, but simply can’t afford them. One nonprofit organization is trying to to help . Homes of Hope International builds houses for families in need    like the Noyes Cervantes family from Tijuana. The family of six lives in a plywood and cinder block structure, measuring 6 feet by 10 feet, with a tarp for a roof and a dirt floor. Luis and Susana share a mattress on the ground with their four children. The family squeezes into the room, which barely holds the mattress, a rickety bookshelf to hold clothes, and a propane burner to cook food. There is no door or windows or even electricity. The only plumbing they have is their makeshift bathroom    a toilet, a hose for a shower, and a utility sink.  ”We’re very cramped. We’re not satisfied,” said Luis. ”It was difficult to sleep at night, all of us on the same mattress and we would complain every day.” Luis works   graveyard shifts at a factory    earning about $75 a week. He saved up enough from his factory job to buy a small piece of land, but he doesn’t have money to build a home. That’s where Homes of Hope International comes in. The group’s founder believes home ownership can help end a family’s poverty. ”When people get a house, they actually think differently about their future,” says Homes of Hope’s Sean Lambert. ”In one generation, you can break the cycle of poverty over a family’s life. ”’ Lambert says providing a safe, clean home can end poverty because families no longer have to save up to build a house. They can put that money towards their children’s education, eat healthier food, and by no longer living on a dirt floor    lower the risk of illnesses. Since its first home in 1990, the organization has built more than 4, 000 houses in the northern Baja region of Mexico. It’s also expanded to other parts of the world such as Africa and Asia. The homes are built by volunteers who sign up to work a weekend alongside Homes of Hope staff. Each house is completed in two days    rain or shine. Jason Solomon volunteered with his family and friends. Solomon was astounded by the Noyes Cervantes’ living conditions and also by their graciousness. ”It was shocking and humbling. ..and overwhelming,” said Solomon who hails from Southern California and works in finance. ”They seem to be happy with what they have.”  To receive a home, a family must own their own land, be employed, and have children. The homes are either 16 by 16 feet or 16 by 20 with three rooms, electricity, windows and doors. They come furnished with new furniture and kitchenware.  ”To just see the joy in their faces and the excitement,” said Solomon, whose teenage son convinced him to volunteer after building a house last year. ”I’m going to see that image probably for the rest of my life.” The Noyes Cervantes family not only received a new home but an unexpected outpouring of support from the volunteers.  ”I was shocked because there is a lot of love coming from people that do not know you, yet they give you a lot of love and so much security,” said Susana.

8,Scientists Say the Clock of Aging May Be Reversible - The New York Times,2017-04-14,"At the Salk Institute in La Jolla, Calif. scientists are trying to get time to run backward. Biological time, that is. In the first attempt to reverse aging by reprogramming the genome, they have rejuvenated the organs of mice and lengthened their life spans by 30 percent. The technique, which requires genetic engineering, cannot be applied directly to people, but the achievement points toward better understanding of human aging and the possibility of rejuvenating human tissues by other means. The Salk team’s discovery, reported in the Thursday issue of the journal Cell, is “novel and exciting,” said Jan Vijg, an expert on aging at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York. Leonard Guarente, who studies the biology of aging at M. I. T. said, “This is huge,” citing the novelty of the finding and the opportunity it creates to slow down, if not reverse, aging. “It’s a pretty remarkable finding, and if it holds up it could be quite important in the history of aging research,” Dr. Guarente said. The finding is based on the heterodox idea that aging is not irreversible and that an animal’s biological clock can in principle be wound back to a more youthful state. The aging process is clocklike in the sense that a steady accumulation of changes eventually degrades the efficiency of the body’s cells. In one of the deepest mysteries of biology, the clock’s hands are always set back to zero at conception: However old the parents and their reproductive cells, a fertilized egg is free of all marks of age. Ten years ago, the Japanese biologist Shinya Yamanaka amazed researchers by identifying four critical genes that reset the clock of the fertilized egg. The four genes are so powerful that they will reprogram even the genome of skin or intestinal cells back to the embryonic state. Dr. Yamanaka’s method is now routinely used to change adult tissue cells into cells very similar to the embryonic stem cells produced in the first few divisions of a fertilized egg. Scientists next began to wonder if the four Yamanaka genes could be applied not just to cells in glassware but to a whole animal. The results were disastrous. As two groups of researchers reported in 2013 and 2014, the animals all died, some because their adult tissue cells had lost their identity and others from cancer. Embryonic cells are primed for rapid growth, which easily becomes uncontrolled. But at the Salk Institute, Juan Carlos Izpisua Belmonte had been contemplating a different approach. He has long been interested in regeneration, the phenomenon in which certain animals, like lizards and fish, can regenerate lost tails or limbs. The cells near the lost appendage revert to a stage midway between an embryonic cell, which is open to all fates, and an adult cell, which is committed to being a particular type of cell, before rebuilding the missing limb. This partial reprogramming suggested to him that reprogramming is a stepwise process, and that a small dose of the Yamanaka factors might rejuvenate cells without the total reprogramming that converts cells to the embryonic state. With Alejandro Ocampo and other Salk researchers, Dr. Izpisua Belmonte has spent five years devising ways to deliver a nonlethal dose of Yamanaka factors to mice. The solution his team developed was to genetically engineer mice with extra copies of the four Yamanaka genes, and to have the genes activated only when the mice received a certain drug in their drinking water, applied just two days a week. The Salk team worked first with mice that age prematurely, so as to get quick results. “What we saw is that the animal has fewer signs of aging, healthier organs, and at the end of the experiment we could see they had lived 30 percent longer than control mice,” Dr. Izpisua Belmonte said. The team also saw improved organ health in normal mice but, because the mice are still living, could not yet say if longevity was extended. Dr. Izpisua Belmonte believes these beneficial effects have been obtained by resetting the clock of the aging process. The clock is created by the epigenome, the system of proteins that clads the cell’s DNA and controls which genes are active and which are suppressed. When an egg develops into a whole animal, the epigenome plays a critical role by letting a heart cell, say, activate just the genes specific to its role but switching off all the genes used by other types of cells. This process lets the embryo’s cells differentiate into all the various types of cells required by the adult body. The epigenome is also involved throughout life in maintaining each cell and letting it switch genes on and off as required for its housekeeping duties. The epigenome itself is controlled by agents that add or subtract chemical groups, known as marks, to its proteins. Only in the last few years have biologists come to realize that the state of the epigenome may be a major cause of aging. If the epigenome is damaged, perhaps by accumulating too many marks, the cell’s efficiency is degraded. Dr. Izpisua Belmonte sees the epigenome as being like a manuscript that is continually edited. “At the end of life there are many marks and it is difficult for the cell to read them,” he said. What the Yamanaka genes are doing in his mice, he believes, is eliminating the extra marks, thus reverting the cell to a more youthful state. The Salk biologists “do indeed provide what I believe to be the first evidence that partial reprogramming of the genome ameliorated symptoms of tissue degeneration and improved regenerative capacity,” Dr. Vijg said. But he cautioned the   mice used in the study might not be fully representative of ordinary aging. Dr. Guarente said it was more likely that the Yamanaka genes were not erasing the epigenomic marks directly, but rather were activating the genes which are responsible for the immense health and vitality of embryonic cells. This gene activation is a natural function of the Yamanaka factors. It is these embryonic   genes that are rejuvenating the tissues in the mice, Dr. Guarente suggested, and causing changes in the epigenome through their activity. Thomas A. Rando, an expert on stem cells and aging at Stanford, said that it should be possible in theory to uncouple the differentiation program and the aging process, and that “if that’s what’s happening, this is the first demonstration of that. ” Dr. Izpisua Belmonte said he was testing drugs to see if he could achieve the same rejuvenation as with the Yamanaka factors. The use of chemicals “will be more translatable to human therapies and clinical applications,” he said."
9,"AEI: Elites Need to Talk to Populist, Nationalist in ’Respectful.. Understandable’ Way - Breitbart",2016-04-09,"Leon Aron writes at the American Enterprise Institute:  From Alabama to Denmark, Nevada to the Netherlands, and from Arizona to Sweden and Germany, Hungary and Poland, voters are flocking to   populist, nationalist, isolationist, and nativist demagogues, parties, and movements. The trend sweeping Europe and the United States is broader and deeper than politics. The attraction of these suddenly popular phenomena appear to stem in a larger measure from an enormous gap between the beliefs of the “ ” and largely   Western elites (political, media, cultural, academic) on the one hand, and their countries’ hoi polloi on the other. This chasm is not merely ideological. It is ethical, linguistic  —   almost anthropological. For the elites, nothing, or almost nothing, is “written in stone. ” Everything is fluid, situational, pragmatically determined. As the founder of existentialism,   Sartre put it, “existence precedes essence. ” With “God dead,” as Nietzsche famously proclaimed, ethical absolutes are no more. Values are a matter of personal choice  —   and one is just as good as another. Nothing and no one is better or worse. Just “different. ” There is no “truth” but multiple “truths. ” And, following another postulate of   articulated by Nietzsche, “there are no facts, only interpretations. ” Hence the         approach of elite media which gives equal credence to, say, democratically elected governments and unelected dictatorships. [  …    ] The “cultural” difference between the elites and the “people” has always existed. But the size of the gulf today may have rendered populist demagogues on both the right and left dangerously more attractive. Let us hope that the Western establishment sees the danger and starts adjusting its vocabulary and values to the point where it can talk to its people in ways that the latter will find credible, respectful, and understandable.

10,Arizona’s #Deadbeat Program Successfully Shaming Parents Into Paying Child Support - Breitbart,2016-04-12,"Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey ( ) set up a program in January 2016 that would publicly shame parents who owe child support in order to get them to pay up, according to a report by Tucson News Now.  The #Deadbeat program shames parents who owe child support by their names, photos, and the amount of child support they owe by posting it on a Twitter account. The Twitter account is managed by the Arizona Department of Economic Security, and has shamed 40 people in the first four months. Of the 40 named people, six of them have already been found. The Arizona Department of Economic Security has received over 300 tips on the others so far. The department has more than 400 more parents who owe child support to shame online. The “deadbeats” all owe over $5, 000 in child support, have not paid in at least six months and also have a warrant out for their arrest. Daniel Ruiz II, Director of Media Affairs at Arizona Governor’s Office told Tucson News Now of the program: “The #deadbeat initiative is a success. We’ve located child support evaders, and the initiative is serving as a deterrent  —   encouraging evaders to pay up to avoid being featured on social media. Parents have an obligation to their children and there should be zero tolerance for those who skirt their financial responsibilities. ” Follow Breitbart. tv on Twitter @BreitbartVideo"
11,Kellogg Foundation’s Director of Racial Equity Wanted Castro to ’Rest In Power’,2016-12-02,"With the Kellogg Company’s announcement that they pulled their advertising from Breitbart News because Breitbart isn’t “aligned with our values,” many consumers might wonder what those values are. The company’s namesake nonprofit organization, the W. K. Kellogg Foundation, offers the best glimpse into the cereal giant’s beliefs and a look at the writings and social media postings of the foundation’s Director of Racial Equity reveals expressions of sympathy for the murderous communist dictator Fidel Castro and antipathy towards police. [According to the W. K. Kellogg Foundation’s website, its Director of Racial Equity and community engagement is Rev. Alvin Herring. Rev. Herring’s LinkedIn resume shows he’s spent years as a director with the PICO National Network, one of many prominent institutional left activist groups funded in part by leftwing billionaire George Soros.  Rev. Herring paid tribute to Fidel Castro in a recent tweet: Rest in power #Fiidel,  —   Rev. Alvin Herring (@Alvin4Community) November 26, 2016,  In another tweet, Rev. Herring reposts an article called “Why black Americans love Fidel Castro” that praised Castro for pardoning convicted cop killer Assata Shakur. https:  .   —   Rev. Alvin Herring (@Alvin4Community) November 27, 2016,  In the article written by Hermano Fidel and tweeted by the Kellogg Foundation’s Rev. Herring, Castro is praised for harboring   black nationalist extremist JoAnne Chesimard, AKA Assata Shakur: When it came to matching words with deeds on the topic of racial equality, the most stalwart leader of the Western hemisphere, over the course of the 20th century, was Fidel Castro  …       …    It was Fidel who gave amnesty to Joanne Chesimard, known now as Assata Shakur, still wanted in the 1973 killing of a New Jersey state trooper, Werner Foerster, in a highway shootout. Shakur was convicted but was busted out of prison in 1979 by comrades. As a leading figure in the Black Liberation Army, which took bolder actions than even the Black Panther Party did, not only getting into gun fights with cops but holding up banks, Shakur became a legend in her time, a Robin Hood of the black masses. As Breitbart News has reported, Shakur was part of a group known as the Black Liberation Army, whose members killed a number of police officers in a nationwide reign of terror in the early 1970s. Shakur was tried and convicted of the murder of a New Jersey state trooper, but later escaped from prison with the help of a   radical group known as The Family, which included members of the Weather Underground. At that point, Shakur fled to Cuba, where she has been living in exile ever since. The author of the article that Herring retweeted goes on to call Fidel “a kind of Martin Luther King with power. ” Rev. Herring’s own writings show his willingness to blame law enforcement and side with rioters. In an article written by Rev. Herring for Sojourners in August of 2016 about the Ferguson protests, he shifts the blame away from the rioters and onto the police: Last night democracy was trampled not as the media would suggest by the angry footfalls of sullen youth determined to disturb the peace and wreak havoc in their own community, but by the heavy march of a police force that seemed determined to create tension and antagonize young people  —   young people who are carrying the trauma of nights of unrest and lifetimes of dehumanizing racism. Law enforcement was outfitted with the machinery of war. The officers wore military fatigues and carried automatic weapons. They were helmeted, with their faces obscured, and in the darkness they looked more like machines than human beings. They perched atop huge military vehicles with glaring lights and screeching sirens. It was otherworldly  —   and all of this to face down a group of wounded children, wounded tonight and many nights before this night. Sojourners has received major funding in the past from the   Open Society Foundation, as well as various other funders in the institutional left. The Discover Institute’s Jay Richards reported on Sojourners’ funding in an article on National Review:   …    it’s implausible for [Sojourners President and Founder Jim] Wallis to claim that grants between 2004 and 2007 totaling $325, 000 are “the tiniest fraction” of Sojourners’ funding. Besides the Soros grants, for instance, there are two 2006 grants from the infamous Tides Foundation totaling $72, 106 a Ford Foundation grant in 2008 for $100, 000 a Rockefeller Brothers Fund grant for $100, 000 in 2005 and a $50, 000 grant from the Wallace Global Fund in 2008. As Breitbart News has reported, the   groups the Tides Center and Tides Foundation, based in San Francisco, have received over 120 grants from the W. K. Kellogg Foundation.

14,"Bao Bao, an American-Born Panda, Steps Out in China - The New York Times",2017-03-27,"CHENGDU, China  —   Strange food. Unintelligible natives. These are just some of the things that Bao Bao, the    panda from the National Zoo in Washington, has grappled with since moving to China last month. But the culture shock is fading, her handlers say, as she settles into the land of her ancestors. On Friday, after 30 days of quarantine, Bao Bao made her first public appearance at the Dujiangyan base of the China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda in Sichuan Province. Bao Bao’s new life in China has been not easy, according to Tang Cheng, one of her keepers during her quarantine. Over the past month, she has had to learn Mandarin with a Sichuan accent and get used to the local fare  —   including wowotou, or steamed cornbread buns, in place of the biscuits she was used to. By now, Bao Bao can understand some commands in Chinese, including “stand up” and “sit down,” Mr. Tang said. Mr. Tang was selected to work with Bao Bao in part because he speaks English as well as Chinese, an important skill to help haigui, or overseas returned, pandas to adapt to their new homes. At the ceremony on Friday, several United States diplomats and dozens of reporters and other guests were on hand to greet Bao Bao. Although they were clearly excited to see her for the first time, waving their hands and shouting her name to get her attention, Bao Bao seemed unimpressed. She spent most of the time sitting in her outdoor playground, munching on bamboo. From time to time, she would examine the rubber balls and tires hanging near her brick enclosure. According to Mr. Tang, Bao Bao spent her first few days in China overcoming jet lag and by now has settled into a routine: four to six meals a day, of bamboo, carrots, apples and wowotou. At first she did not like the wowotou and tended to throw it away. By now, though, Mr. Tang said, “she is adapting well to her new environment,” and has gained more than four pounds. Bao Bao is not the first   panda to face the challenges of a new life. In November, when Mei Lun and Mei Huan, the first surviving panda twins to have been born in the United States, at Zoo Atlanta, came to China, the Chinese news media reported that they, too, had difficulties with the local language and food. According to the conservation and research center, 25 pandas have been born abroad since the 1990s, when China set up panda breeding programs in collaboration with 17 zoos in 12 countries. Of these, 18 have survived. By agreement, pandas provided by China are considered loans, and their offspring must be sent to China before their fourth birthday in preparation for breeding. Bao Bao was born on Aug. 23, 2013, to Mei Xiang and Tian Tian, two pandas on loan to the National Zoo. Her older brother, Tai Shan, who was born in 2005 and sent to China in 2010, is now her neighbor at the Dujiangyan base. A younger brother, Bei Bei, was born in 2015 and is still in Washington. A 2016 report by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature put the total number of giant pandas around 2, 060. While that is up from the 1, 596 counted in a   census, the health of the population depends on continued conservation efforts. Each panda has a mission to spread the genes, and Bao Bao is no exception. Once she reaches sexual maturity, around 5 or 6 years old, she will acquire a boyfriend. “When Bao Bao gets to that age, we will arrange for her to meet many young males,’’ Mr. Tang said, “and their relationship will be based on love. ”"

[In a statement released this Thursday, police in the town of Brühl in the   district of   confirmed the parish centre had been broken into on the evening of 30 December.  They said the vandals had left a “picture of devastation” destroying glass panes, breaking doors and writing “Islamist” slogans on the walls. Despite the nature of the slogans, however, police have said they “do not assume” they are relevant to the motive for the attack. A number of Christian sites were attacked in Germany and Austria during the New Year period, with the perpetrators still largely unknown. Breitbart London reported last week on a series of attacks on chapels and shrines in northern Austria, with statues beheaded, prayer books burned and sacred images destroyed. In one incident in the village of St Radegund, vandals damaged a statue of the Virgin Mary before stealing prayer books and wooden objects and burning them in a nearby wood. In a similar attack in Braunau am Inn, just a few miles away, vandals stole a Christ figure from a cross and beheaded a statue of St Barbara, causing an estimated 5, 000 euros of damage. The attacks are nothing new, however. In November, Breitbart London reported on similar incidents in the German town of Dülmen, where Christian statues were damaged and destroyed. Noses and fingers were smashed off, while some were even beheaded. Police said the attacks could be religiously motived, however they struggled to find the culprits. Germany and Austria witnesses a massive influx of mainly Muslim migrants over the past couple of years as part of Europe’s ongoing migrant crisis. In September last year, an inquiry by the Austria’s Freedom Party claimed over 120, 000 illegal migrants had entered the country over the previous year."

18,Russia puts Northern Fleet on ’full alert’,2015-03-16," (CNN) As the U. S. and several Eastern European NATO countries conduct a series of military exercises near Russia’s border, Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered his Northern Fleet ”to full alert in a snap combat readiness exercise” in the Arctic,   media reported Monday.  At least one Russian leader described the drill as routine and unrelated to the ”international situation.” The fleet got its orders at 8 a. m. Monday, according to Sputnik, launching a land, sea and air drill that will involve 38, 000 troops, 41 ships, 15 submarines and 110 aircraft.  ”The main task of the (combat readiness drill) is to assess the armed forces from the Northern Fleet’s capabilities in fulfilling tasks in providing military security of the Russian Federation in the Arctic region,” Russian Defense Minister Gen. Sergey Shoigu told the media outlet. ”New challenges and threats of military security demand the further heightening of military capabilities of the armed forces and special attention will be paid to the state of the newly formed strategic merging (of forces) in the North.” The drills will run through Friday, Sputnik reported.  A flotilla of minesweepers will support the Northern Fleet’s nuclear submarines in the Barents Sea as part of the drill, the Tass news agency reported, citing a Defense Ministry statement.  ”  groups of the Kola Flotilla have moved to the designated areas of the Barents within the framework of a snap check of combat readiness of the Northern Fleet forces for supporting the deployment of the main forces of the fleet, including the deployment of nuclear and diesel submarines of the Northern Fleet,” the statement says. The ships will conduct magnetic, acoustic and contact demining sweeps during the drill, Tass reported.  Despite a number of countries participating in various military drills in Eastern Europe, a Kremlin spokesman described the Northern Fleet inspection as routine practice aimed at improving military capabilities.  ”The practice of snap checks will become regular, as it is beneficial for improving the mechanisms of control and operation of the armed forces. This is an absolutely regular process of the armed forces’ operation, of preparation and development of Russia’s armed forces,” Dmitry Peskov told Tass on Monday. Conversely, a diplomat told Tass that Russia was ”deeply concerned” about NATO drills near its border.  ”It is especially surprising that this is happening in Northeastern Europe, which is the most stable region not only on our continent, but also maybe in the whole world,” Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexey Meshkov said. ”Such NATO actions lead to destabilization of the situation and increasing tensions in Northeastern Europe.” Among the recent drills in Eastern Europe: • In its largest military operation in decades, Norway sent 5, 000 troops to conduct military exercises between Alta and Lakselv in Finnmark county, which borders Russia, according to the Barents Observer.  • About 100 U. S. soldiers are expected to conduct an exercise this month using a Patriot missile battery and a Polish air defense brigade ”at a location on Polish territory,” Pentagon spokesman Col. Steve Warren said. The exercise is part of Operation Atlantic Resolve, which began in response to Russia’s involvement in Ukraine and its annexation of Crimea last year, the U. S. Defense Department said.  • Also as part of Operation Atlantic Resolve, the U. S. Army will soon send armored Stryker vehicles on a   convoy through six European countries to show solidarity with its allies. The ”highly visible” convoy will travel through Estonia, Lithuania, Poland, Latvia and the Czech Republic en route to Vilseck, Germany, a U. S. Army Europe spokesman told the military newspaper, Stars and Stripes. • In a ”regularly scheduled” exercise aimed at demonstrating NATO’s commitment to ”collective defense” in the Black Sea, the Standing NATO Maritime Group Two    a collection of warships    will train with the Bulgarian, Romanian and Turkish navies and visit Varna, Bulgaria, to meet with local authorities and navy officials, NATO said.  • The U. S. Air Force moved a dozen   Thunderbolt ”tankbuster” attack jets to an air base in Germany and the U. S. military placed hundreds of tanks and military vehicles in Latvia, where they’ll be matched up with 3, 000 troops from Fort Stewart, Georgia."

21,"Dallas Shootings Were ‘Vicious’ and ‘Despicable,’ Obama Says - The New York Times",2016-07-09,"WARSAW  —   President Obama on Friday deplored the shooting deaths of five police officers in Dallas, saying there was “no possible justification” for such a “vicious, calculated and despicable attack on law enforcement. ” “We are horrified over these events,” he said, “and we stand united with the people and the Police Department in Dallas. ” Mr. Obama said that he had spoken to Mayor Mike Rawlings of Dallas, and that the F. B. I. was in contact with the Dallas authorities. The president said nearly a dozen police officers had been shot, several were wounded, and five had died. The president cautioned that a lot about the attack was still not known. “But let’s be clear,” he said, “there’s no possible justification for these kinds of attacks, or any violence against law enforcement. ” Mr. Obama’s remarks, delivered in Warsaw after a meeting with European leaders, were the second time in less than 12 hours that he had interrupted his trip to the NATO summit meeting to address a surge of   violence on American streets. Earlier on Friday, he spoke about shootings by police officers in Minnesota and Louisiana, which he said were “symptomatic of a broader set of racial disparities that exist in our criminal justice system. ” Mr. Obama emphasized that his critique, however impassioned, should not be interpreted as an attack on law enforcement itself. Now, Mr. Obama finds himself condemning those who targeted police officers in Dallas during a protest against those shootings. “Today is a wrenching reminder of the sacrifices they make for us,” he said. “Anyone involved in the senseless murders will be held fully accountable,” Mr. Obama said. “Justice will be done. ” The sudden escalation of violence in the United States left the president clearly shaken, and it raised questions about whether he would curtail his trip. After the   summit meeting in Warsaw, Mr. Obama is scheduled to fly to Spain for a day of sightseeing in Seville, a visit with American troops at a naval base and lunch with King Felipe VI. White House officials had no announcements on the president’s itinerary, but officials said the situation was in flux. Even before the news from the United States, the NATO meeting was opening amid an atmosphere of disarray. European leaders are grappling with the continuing fallout from Britain’s vote to leave the European Union and with how to confront renewed Russian aggression on the border with Ukraine. It is not the first time that outside events have disrupted a foreign trip by Mr. Obama. In March, during a historic trip to Cuba, he awoke to news of deadly terrorist attacks in  Brussels. In the fall, he set off on a    trip shortly after the terrorist attacks in Paris that killed 130 people. In both cases, he stuck to his schedule. Mr. Obama has had to walk a fine line in reacting to the deadly skein of shootings, balancing his call for rooting out racial injustice with compassion for the sacrifices made by police officers. Earlier on Friday, he spoke of receiving letters from law enforcement officials after a shooting by a police officer, in which they ask, “How come we’re under attack? How come not as much emphasis is made when police officers are shot?” But he said that did not change the fact that there are biases in the criminal justice system that need to be rooted out. And he said that people should not condemn the protests, vigils and other public responses to shootings as a form of political correctness. “When people say black lives matter, that doesn’t mean blue lives don’t matter,” Mr. Obama said. “It just means all lives matter. ” Still, he added, “The data shows black folks are more vulnerable to these kinds of incidents. ” Mr. Obama recited statistics on police stops and searches, as well as sentences and incarceration rates, which showed that blacks and Hispanics were treated differently from whites. “We can do better,” he said. “People of good will can do better. ”"
22,Army Falls to Lowest Numbers in 200 Years,2016-09-03,"The number of regular soldiers in Britain’s army has fallen below 80, 000, the lowest it has been for over 200 years, the latest manning figures show. [The Army was slashed by the government from 102, 000 to a target of 82, 000 during the 2010 defence review  —   reducing it to the smallest British force since the Napoleonic Wars  —   driven by the austerity budget introduced by the coalition government. Reservists were expected to make up the shortfall, increasing from 19, 000 to 30, 000.  But the latest personnel figures from the Ministry of Defence show that the army only had 79, 590 trained regular soldiers in July, while the RAF and Navy also both fell hundreds short. Low morale, low unemployment and a lack of   operations are all contributing to a recruitment rate at only 90 percent of target rates, officers told The Telegraph.  One Army source said: “It’s a competitive market out there. In a recession we find it easier to recruit and when things are on the upturn, we find it more difficult. “When we are on operations, it’s a little bit easier strangely enough. Soldiers want to get out there and get rounds down. ” Charles Heyman, editor of Armed Forces of the United Kingdom and a former infantry officer, said: “It’s significant because it is part of a trend and the Army is going to find it difficult to catch up quickly. “There’s no doubt that not having Afghanistan does have an impact on recruiting. There’s a lot of opportunities in civilian life and there’s not really any fresh thinking about how to get people to serve in the Army. ” Heyman said that outsourcing recruitment to the services firm Capita had further hindered recruitment, as the process was overly bureaucratic and staff were less likely to ‘sell’ army life to potential new recruits. “I went to a recruiting office in North London and a   sergeant said, ‘You are just the kind of lad we want’ and he talked me into it. Capita is not doing well at recruiting. It’s difficult to get an application through the system,” he said. Both Heyman and other former officers are concerned about the effect a reduced force will have on operational readiness, should the need arise. Heyman said: “If a major operation comes up then of course all the strains and stresses will show up immediately. It will be difficult to make it work. ” Meanwhile Col Richard Kemp, a former commander of British forces in Afghanistan, said defence cuts had left Britain “dangerously exposed at a time of growing risk”. “Cutting to such levels clearly demonstrates a lack of will to defend ourselves, shows weakness and is an invitation to enemies and potential enemies to attack us,” he said. “We depend on the US for significant security cover but there have been signs for some years of their exasperation with European countries for not doing enough to help themselves. ” A Ministry of Defence spokesman said: “The Army offers exciting opportunities that inspire the best of our young people and we are committed to recruiting to 82, 000. “Today the Army is active across the world to keep Britain safe and has the manpower needed to meet its operational commitments. ”"
23,A family’s grief as more Nice victims identified,2016-07-18,"Nice, France (CNN) For two days after the attack, Aldjia Bouzaouit’s family walked up and down the Promenade des Anglais holding her photograph, desperately asking   if they had seen her. On Sunday, the family received the news it never wanted to hear. ”My sister died. I got the confirmation today. She died right away during the attack,” her brother, Bilal Bouilfane, told CNN. ”She was a very kind woman. She had four children, and worked at the clinic. She was a practicing Muslim,” he says. Bouzaouit, in her 40s, had taken two of her four children down to the promenade on Thursday to attend the Bastille Day celebrations, which culminates in a huge fireworks display in the evening. Just minutes after the fireworks ended, Mohamed Lahouaiej Bouhlel began his rampage, shooting at the crowd and plowing them down with a rented   refrigerator truck. ISIS has claimed Bouhlel as one of their ”soldiers,” although officials say a clear link to the extremist group has yet to be established.   people were killed in the attack. Bouzaouit’s children survived. Difficult task to ID victims, Until Sunday, less than half of those victims had been identified, largely due to the severity of the damage to the bodies. On Tuesday, the Italian foreign ministry identified four more Italian nationals, adding to its earlier identification of Mario Casati, whom it named Monday. The additional names were Carla Gaveglio, Maria Grazia Ascoli, Gianna Muset and Angelo D’Agostino. According to the ministry, the victims’ families have been informed and are receiving assistance from the Italian consulate.  The Paris prosecutor’s office said Monday that 71 have now been identified, meaning the waiting for many of the families is over, but the grieving process is only just beginning. Aldjia Bouzaouit’s family had feared the worst, but relatives still held on to hope that she had survived. Now they face the heartbreaking task of telling Aldjia’s two other children who have been on holiday in Algeria with their grandparents. ”They left two weeks ago, and now they want to come back to see their mom,” Bilal Bouilfane says. ”I’ve been lying to them for the last two days. I give them hope, when I knew that it was over.” Prayers, solidarity, Prayers were said Sunday for Aldjia during a service for victims at a local mosque. During the service, some people rose to speak, saying ”I lost my nephew,” ”I lost my grandchild and my daughter,” and ”I lost my wife.” The mosque lost 10 members in the attack, a poignant reminder that Thursday’s massacre was an attack against everyone, regardless of religion or nationality. That solidarity is bringing the people of Nice together in grief. ”Tonight’s gathering helps us. It’s beautiful, when I see Christians, Jewish people and Muslims,” Aldjia’s brother Bilal says. ”Everyone hugged me today, in the streets, people from all faiths, all colors. Everyone got together, and it’s beautiful.”"
24,Mega-Donors Raise $1 Billion for Hillary Clinton - Breitbart,2016-10-23,"Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has raised over $1 billion for her campaign with the help of some  . [Clinton, with the party and   super PACs, had raised $1. 14 billion in support of her campaign by the end of September, about the same amount as what Obama raised in 2012 for his   campaign, the Washington Post reports.  Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, who did not start aggressively fundraising until May, had collected $712 million, including $56 million of his own money. Part of Clinton’s advantage in fundraising comes from her decision to embrace super PACs from the start of the presidential race, helping her to get more out of donors than Obama did. A Washington Post analysis found that more than a fifth of the $1 billion donated to her campaign was given by just 100 wealthy individuals and labor unions, many with a long history of donating to the Clintons. The analysis included contributions to her campaigns, joint fundraising committees, national parties, convention host committees, and   super PACs. The top five donors to Clinton’s campaign combined gave one out of every $17 to her presidential bid. Her top donors included hedge fund manager S. Donald Sussman ($20. 6 million) Chicago venture capitalist J. B. Pritzker and his wife, M. K. ($16. 7 million) Univision chairman Haim Saban and his wife, Cheryl ($11. 9 million) hedge fund titan George Soros ($9. 9 million) and SlimFast founder S. Daniel Abraham ($9. 7 million). Clinton kept these donors in her circle because she consistently wooed competing interests groups and donors from Wall Street and tech companies in addition to her liberal base."

28,Dershowitz Questions Purpose of Special Counsel - ’What Is the Crime?’ - Breitbart,2017-05-18,"Thursday on CNN’s “Anderson Cooper 360,” Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz called into question the purpose of the Department of Justice naming Robert Mueller as a special counsel to investigate Russian involvement in the 2016 presidential election.  Dershowitz argued Mueller’s appointment would benefit Trump given that “collaborating with the Russians” to get elected wasn’t illegal and Mueller’s role would be to investigate illegalities. “[I] think he will be the beneficiary of the special prosecutor,” Dershowitz said. “A special prosecutor is supposed to investigate a crime and most of the things that have been leveled at the Trump administration are not criminal acts. Collaborating with the Russians to get yourself elected  —   not a criminal act. Terrible, morally wrong, but not criminal. The same thing is true with the leaking of the information to the Russians. ” Host Anderson Cooper and Dershowitz’s fellow panelists Jeffrey Toobin and Carl Bernstein argued the investigation should proceed, but Dershowitz insisted there wasn’t a criminal statute about what Trump and his campaign have been accused. “Let’s assume that that’s true  —   show me the criminal statute,” he said. “I still sit here as a civil libertarian. I don’t want us ever to become what Stalinist Russia became when Stalin was told by Lavrentiy Beria, ‘Show me the man and I’ll find you the crime.’ What is the crime?” Cooper said the question wasn’t whether or not it was illegal collusion or just collusion but if it occurred, to which Dershowitz said that wasn’t something over which Mueller would have jurisdiction. “[T]hat is a political issue, but that doesn’t give Mueller jurisdiction,” he added. “Mueller has no jurisdiction to explore whether he made political mistakes, did terrible things, engaged in wrongdoing. Only criminal acts. ” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor"
29,A Country He Did Not Recognize: A Reflection on the Passing of Justice Antonin Scalia - Breitbart,2016-03-03,"“The Court must be living in another world. Day by day, case by case, it is busy designing a Constitution for a country I do not recognize. ”  Justice Antonin Scalia, dissenting in Wabaunsee County v. Umbehr (1996) The American flag flew at half staff over   and   protesters outside the Supreme Court this week, while inside the most important abortion case in decades was being reviewed. No one inside or outside the Court could have anticipated that this case, with   implications, would be missing the vital input of Justice Antonin Scalia. In the weeks since his death, I have been rereading some of Justice Scalia’s opinions and dissents and I realize that he was not alone in his assessment that the Supreme Court has constructed a new, very different Constitution from what was drafted in Philadelphia. Our nation’s Founders would not recognize it either. Not only has what Justice Scalia called the “imperial judiciary” given us a new Constitution, it has given us a new government. No longer “of the people,” our government is one that stands above us decreeing which of us are people. It determines who is worthy of protection and who may be terminated and sold as spare parts. The Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade decision created this radical break in the very nature of our country. With the Roe ruling, the court altered not just the words of the Constitution, but the principles upon which it was based. Justice Scalia is famed for his adherence to the Constitution as it was written. An “originalist,” he considered our country’s foundational document to be “enduring,” not “living. ” He didn’t see himself as an editor of the Constitution, but an interpreter a judge, not a legislator. His was a position of humility. Tragically, too many of our leading jurists have succumbed to the temptation to rewrite the Constitution in their own image. Rather than be stalwart defenders of our nation’s founding principles, Supreme Court justices have acted as novelists, repeatedly submitting the Constitution to rewrites. And in declaring the Constitution to be a “breathing” document, the court has sown the wind. We reap the whirlwind. In my book, Abolishing Abortion, I write that the Supreme Court’s enabling of the killing of innocents has altered the very foundation of our government. The consequences of this have been grave  —   almost 60 million aborted babies and countless devastated mothers, fathers, and family members. Pope Saint John Paul II noted in his encyclical “The Gospel of Life” that when governments engage in granting rights to stronger parties and denying them to weaker ones: The State is no longer the ‘common home’ where all can live together on the basis of principles of fundamental equality, but is transformed into a tyrant State, which arrogates to itself the right to dispose of the life of the weakest and most defenseless members. We have become that tyrant state. Our Founders wrote in the Declaration of Independence that “that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. ” They also wrote that “Governments are instituted among Men” for the purpose of securing those rights. The Supreme Court, however, has not secured those rights, it has trod them under foot. In so doing, it has subverted the very concepts upon which our nation was founded. When the court legalized abortion, it changed our government from one that protects unalienable rights to one that dispatches them as it sees fit. It now sees itself as supreme, period. As Justice Scalia repeatedly noted, however, our Founders did not intend for such a seizure of power. One of the most important aspects of the limited government our Founders created was that it would act as a safeguard, as much as possible, against man’s pride and, consequently, his ability to aggregate power. The Justices of the Supreme Court, though, are men and women who are as susceptible to pride as any other human. And when presented with unopposed opportunities to elevate themselves, they have seized them. Justice Scalia, in his inimitable style, noted this phenomenon in his dissent in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, the Supreme Court’s 1992 decision that upheld Roe v. Wade: No government official is “tempted” to place restraints on his own freedom of action, which is why Lord Acton did not say “Power tends to purify. ” That lack of restraint now runs rampant in our judiciary, corrupting our nation and destroying lives. The passing of Justice Scalia is tragic, both for his wonderful family and our beleaguered nation. He was a public servant with a profound understanding of our Republic. Above all, he was a humble man. I saw that firsthand in my conversations with him over the years. If our government is to be restored to its rightful footing, we will need more like him. Fr. Frank Pavone is the National Director of Priests for Life."

S. and his   disavowal of the support he received from white supremacists.’ ’The day after Trump vanquished the last of his 16 primary opponents, Ryan took the gloves off, at least for him. Asked on CNN whether he supports Trump, he replied, “I’m just not ready to do that at this point. I’m not there right now. And I hope to, though, and I want to.

Ryan and Trump are at odds on a host of issues, including trade and foreign policy.’ ’’ ’On top of that, friction between the two may carry some political advantages for each. Trump has risen to the top of the GOP field in part by criticizing the party’s    leadership. And Ryan might see a benefit in distancing himself from his party’s presidential choice; he, like Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( ) is worried that having Trump at the top of the ticket could lead to a   tsunami, with incumbent Republicans swept out of office by an unstoppable Democratic tide.’ ’If there’s enough room between Trump and congressional Republicans, the GOP might be able to hold onto its majorities in both chambers. If not, Ryan, who last month delivered a  statement that he would not seek the nomination in 2016, might turn his gaze to the 2020 race.’"

35,"At Dinner Honoring Mike Pence, Donald Trump Touches Many Bases - The New York Times",2017-01-19,"WASHINGTON  —     Donald J. Trump, in a   speech Wednesday night at a dinner honoring his running mate, Mike Pence, jabbed at his new Republican allies and his critics alike, questioned the ethics of “super PACs” and talked about creating a “ ” immigration system. Mr. Trump credited Mr. Pence with helping to bring critics around to the ticket. “They all liked Mike. They were a little bit, you know, a little concerned with me,” the   said, drawing laughter from the crowd of about 500 people, which included donors, cabinet appointees and other supporters. Mr. Trump said that his aides told him that he was not required to be at the dinner, but that he thought he had to be there to honor a man whose role on the ticket he described as one of his best decisions. Mr. Trump lauded Mr. Pence in a roughly   speech, but poked at him for declining to endorse his candidacy in the primary in Indiana, where he was governor, instead backing Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. “The fact that every donor he had was in favor of” Mr. Cruz played no role in the decision, Mr. Trump said sarcastically, according to a recording provided by a guest. In the  ’s telling, Mr. Pence essentially endorsed him, and mentioned Mr. Cruz only as an afterthought. Mr. Trump also took aim at Mr. Cruz (a “smart guy, he was a little late to the plate, but that’s O. K. ”) Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, a rival in the primary (“he can be nasty, that Scott Walker”) members of the “Never Trump” movement (“they’re really right now on a respirator they’re pretty much gone”) and the casino magnate Sheldon Adelson (he mocked him for being late to donate promised money to outside groups supporting his candidacy). Such groups, like super PACs, need to be “straightened out,” Mr. Trump said. “People get very rich running PACs. ” On immigration, two days before he assumes the power to begin rolling back President Obama’s executive orders, Mr. Trump said: “We’re working on the border. We want people to come into our country, but we want them to come in legally. ” He added that he wanted the immigration system “at least a certain degree to be  . ” It was not clear what that would entail. Mr. Trump, who has proposed “extreme vetting” of immigrants to weed out potential terrorists, said he wanted people who arrived here to work hard, but added, “We want people to come into our country who are going to love us and respect us. ” In a series of interludes and asides, Mr. Trump described asking the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, to focus on the effort to replace the Affordable Care Act, then shifted to talking about a change to the tax system. Mr. Trump said that people compared his success to the popular movement that put Andrew Jackson in the White House. “There hasn’t been anything like this since Andrew Jackson,” Mr. Trump quoted his admirers saying. “Andrew Jackson? What year was Andrew Jackson? That was a long time ago. ” Mr. Trump then gave the year  —   1828  —   and went on to suggest that his own nationalist movement had usurped Mr. Jackson’s. He said that even “the haters” who disliked him called his movement “unprecedented. ” Mr. Trump expressed gratitude to black voters who had stayed home on Election Day “because they liked me, or they liked me enough that they just said, ‘No reason. ’” Before returning to New York, Mr. Trump stopped by the Trump International Hotel, a few blocks from the White House, to have dinner. He did not dine at the Pence dinner or at a later dinner for his cabinet picks."
36,"Why Democrats Now Need the F.B.I. Director, James Comey - The New York Times",2017-04-26,"WASHINGTON  —   After incurring their wrath for his handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s email use, some Democrats now see James B. Comey, the F. B. I. director, as a potential ally in trying to block   Donald J. Trump’s promises to revive the practice of sending terrorism suspects to the military prison at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, and interrogate them using banned techniques such as waterboarding. For three years, Mr. Comey has helped carry out President Obama’s counterterrorism vision, in which F. B. I. agents have interrogated suspected terrorists and turned them over to the Justice Department for prosecution in criminal courts. During his confirmation hearing in 2013, Mr. Comey told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he believed waterboarding was torture. Mr. Trump’s nominee to serve as attorney general, Senator Jeff Sessions, has been a fierce critic of the Obama administration’s approach. He has argued that terrorism suspects should be sent to Guantánamo Bay and interrogated without access to lawyers and the right to remain silent. If confirmed, Mr. Sessions would be Mr. Comey’s boss. Mr. Sessions has also said the United States weakened itself by banning techniques such as waterboarding, which he said were legal and effective. He voted against the Detainee Treatment Act in 2005 that prohibited cruel or degrading treatment of detainees. Last year, he voted against legislation requiring all government agencies to use only interrogation methods in the Army Field Manual. Those techniques do not include waterboarding. Mr. Sessions has said he would not rule out waterboarding again. “This would be unwise advice to the enemy we face,” the senator said in 2008. He has opposed the closing of the Guantánamo Bay prison and the transporting of terrorists to the United States to face trial in federal court. The positions taken by Mr. Comey in recent years could put him at odds with not just Mr. Sessions but other members of Mr. Trump’s national security team. “Given the recent slate of appointments from the   F. B. I. Director Comey may well turn out to be a bulwark against the worst abuses and provide some defense of the rule of law,” said Faiza Patel of the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University, who is a frequent critic of the F. B. I. Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, who was offered the key position of national security adviser in the Trump White House, has said he might be open to using enhanced interrogation techniques, with certain limits, if the country faced a terrorism attack using weapons of mass destruction or another grave threat. Representative Mike Pompeo, Republican of Kansas, Mr. Trump’s choice to run the Central Intelligence Agency, is an advocate of restarting the agency’s detention and interrogation program, which Mr. Obama ended. Mr. Pompeo has criticized Mr. Obama’s decision in January 2009 to shut down the agency’s   prisons and require all interrogators to strictly adhere to   laws and use only Army Field Manual interrogation techniques. In 2014, he accused Mr. Obama of refusing “to take the war on radical Islamic terrorism seriously,” citing among other policies the “ending our interrogation program in 2009. ” Mr. Pompeo also took aim at a Senate report on the C. I. A. detention and interrogation program, saying its release had put American lives at risk. Under Mr. Comey, the F. B. I. has worked with the military to capture and prosecute   terrorism suspects in federal court. In 2014, F. B. I. agents and Army Delta Force commandoes captured Ahmed Abu Khattala, a suspected ringleader of the 2012 terrorist attacks in Benghazi, Libya, and took him to a Navy ship in the Mediterranean Sea. Republicans, including Mr. Pompeo, criticized the administration, saying Mr. Khattala should have been taken to Guantánamo Bay. Daniel Jones, a former F. B. I. analyst who led the Senate investigation into the C. I. A. detention and interrogation program, said there was no guarantee that Mr. Comey would ally himself with Democrats to oppose a change in policy under Mr. Trump. Mr. Comey’s refusal while deputy attorney general in the George W. Bush administration to sign on to a National Security Agency surveillance program  —   an action that burnished a reputation for political independence  —   “doesn’t mean he’s not a conservative Republican in opposition to the Democratic agenda,” Mr. Jones said. Mr. Comey drew criticism from Democrats after notifying Congress on Oct. 28 that the F. B. I. had discovered emails potentially relevant to the case involving Mrs. Clinton’s use of a private email server as secretary of state, only to say days before the election that they did not change his determination that she should not face charges. Mrs. Clinton, among others, has said his actions contributed to her losing the election. Ali Soufan, a security consultant and former F. B. I. agent who has supported criminal trials for terrorists, said Mr. Comey deserved credit for making hard decisions in the email case. He predicted Mr. Comey would do the same in a new administration. “Will he win all the arguments? I don’t believe so,” he said. “Will he stand up and fight? I believe so. ”"
37,"Pat Caddell: Media Protects Clinton with ‘Biggest, Most Secure Bubble I Have Ever Seen’ - Breitbart",2016-08-08,"On Monday’s Breitbart News Daily, political analyst Pat Caddell told SiriusXM host Stephen K. Bannon that he didn’t think Hillary Clinton’s polling lead over Donald Trump was “totally manufactured,” but he did think her media coverage was “highly orchestrated. ”[“She got a bump out of the convention, just like Trump did. That’s not unusual,” Caddell said. “And then, let’s face it, Donald Trump had a very, very bad week, or ten days. But what we’re watching here are swings that aren’t consistent. All of the tracking polls are much closer, showing less movement  —   movement, but much less movement  —   than these   polls. Some of them are registered voters, some of them are all people. If it’s in the battlegrounds, well, some of those polls I have questions about. ”  “But let’s assume for a moment that that’s real,” he continued. “This is very early in the process. We’re in the longest general election we’ve had since 1960, conventions being that early.  Usually what we’re seeing right now would be what happens at the end of August, the beginning of September. ” He recalled that in 1976 with Carter, and in 1980 with Reagan, “two people that went on to win the presidency,” switching from primaries to the general election campaign was difficult, especially since they were challengers, giving both of them “very rough starts. ” “This is a very volatile political year,” Caddell declared. “A lot of the polling and stuff being done is very superficial. It’s hard not to get those kinds of quick numbers. I think that the structure of the race hasn’t changed, and we’re in an election where the question is her, and her problems, versus Trump and his problems. ”  “But on the question of change, when the question is, do people feel that the country is not just on the right track, but in decline  —   do they feel that the political class is basically rigging the system, and the economic system, against them?  —   we’re talking about vast majorities of Americans,” he said. Bannon asked how it was possible that Hillary Clinton, the ultimate candidate of the status quo, could be leading by eight to ten points in many polls, given the popular insurrection against a rigged system Cadell envisioned. Caddell said it was because so much coverage of the campaign was focused on “the other person,” Donald Trump.  “This race has not defined itself yet,” he said, predicting that if the public concludes Trump is “a safe enough risk to make the kind of changes” people want, his poll numbers will turn around. At the moment, Caddell criticized Trump for not keeping that message of change “front and center” in the campaign.             “Remember the political class, and the elites, only have one way to view the election. They have a mindset about what politics is. They’ve been wrong all year long,” he said. “And yet, they never question their premises. These polls you talked about are also based on those premises. ” He said it was “very instructive” to see Clinton giving a speech to reporters, in which they openly applauded her, as a supportive audience of constituents applauding their chosen candidate. However, this was the same speech in which Clinton tried to explain her false statements about her email server by claiming she had “” and Caddell noted   coverage on Monday morning of “the execution of the Iranian spy,” Shahram Amiri, which prompted speculation that Clinton’s exposed emails might have played a role in his death sentence. Bannon noted there has also been renewed speculation about Clinton’s health, to which Caddell replied, “She has not been a very good candidate, and she’s just very, very contained. ” “I don’t know. I saw it again last night, all the questions being raised, and other things, but who knows? She is the most bubbled, in the biggest, most secure bubble I have ever seen  —   and God knows, when she strays out of it, it’s not good,” Caddell opined, predicting that there would be few unscripted Clinton appearances or QA sessions for the remainder of the campaign. “This is the most united effort by the press, certainly in the 45 years that I’ve been on the national political presidential stage of analysis, that I’ve ever seen them united with this kind of fierceness  —   against one person who they are trying to destroy, where there are no rules, which is Donald Trump,” he said, describing the crucial advantage that might help Clinton overcome her poor campaign performance. “I don’t think there’s anything comparable since ‘64 with Barry Goldwater. You go back  —   and I was very young, but I do remember some of that  —   where you had everybody questioning his sanity, and whatever, in the press. ” “The press is in the business of protecting the political class,” Caddell explained. “The fierceness of their response, as it is in the political class, is not just a little bit inspired by fear that someone who is representing the disruptive majority of America is a threat to their position and power. Donald Trump has got to understand he is, in this campaign, in a different kind of campaign. The country has to understand, we aren’t talking about a press that’s reporting the news. ”  “All you have to do is look at the lack of coverage  —   I mean, yesterday, there were two networks in which there was even no discussion of the ransom payment,” he said, adding incredulously that “you don’t just get in an unmarked airplane with pallets of money on it, and send it someplace, and have the hostages sitting on the ground, ready to go, waiting for that plane to land, and not call it what it is. ”  Caddell stressed that this problem of media bias was not merely an “institutional crisis,” but a “systemic democracy crisis. ” He said the First Amendment protected the press because “there is an implicit bargain that they would protect people from power,” but “they have now become the outriders of power, and that is a crisis. ” “The lines of battle here are being redrawn. This is a new paradigm, and you have to deal with it that way,” Caddell urged, citing two recent manufactured Trump controversies  —   a baby supposedly being thrown out of his speech because it was crying, and a military veteran who gave Trump a copy of his Purple Heart  —   as instances of the press not even bothering to interview the actual people involved, because it would have destroyed their preferred narrative. “All of this stuff designed, as they get their cues  —   they might as well be operating out of Brooklyn headquarters,” Caddell complained, referring to Hillary Clinton’s campaign HQ.

38,Kyrgyzstan President: ’Women In Mini Skirts Don’t Become Islamic Terrorists’,2016-08-16,"People who wear Islamic clothing such as a burqa are more likely to become radicalised and plot terror attacks, the President of Kyrgyzstan, Almazbek Atambayev has said. His remarks, which have provoked widespread criticism, were offered as part of a national debate on Kyrgyzstan’s cultural identity. [His comments, made at a press conference, follow several weeks of controversy over   hoardings going up which urged Kyrgyz women not to adopt clothing such as the burqa, niqab or hijab, the BBC has reported.  The President has previously made it clear that he has no problem with Muslim traditions, but opposes the ‘Arabization’ of Kyrgyzstan, the population of which is about 80 percent Muslim. The hoardings show contrasting images: to the left a group of women dressed in traditional Kyrgyz attire, to the right a group of women in niqabs and black burqas, covering all but their eyes. Under the images, white text in a red arrow pointing towards the right reads: “Poor people! Where are we heading to?” Responding to criticism of the advert, President Atambayev said: “When we erected banners some smart people appeared and started pointing at miniskirts. Our women have been wearing miniskirts since 1950s, and they never thought about wearing an explosive belt. “You can wear even tarpaulin boots on your head, but do not organise bombings. This is not religion. Let them wear even miniskirts but there must not be any blasts. ” He asserted that the wearing of Islamic garb is not only out of step with the Kyrgyz national culture, but also has the potential to radicalise the wearer. “Terrorists are insane people,” he said. “Clothes also can change one’s thoughts sometimes. “When we were searching for prisoners who had escaped a detention centre, Melis Turganbayev [the former interior minister] came to me and said that they had been eavesdropping on telephone conversations of wives and mistresses of criminals. Their wives and mistresses wore sacks on their heads and they wanted to organise bombings. ” Addressing to those who adopt Islamic veils and values, he continued: “If you do not like Kyrgyzstan you can leave our country and go wherever you want. We can pay your travel expenses, even to Syria. ” A state commission has ruled that the hoardings do not breach advertising laws, but the Spiritual Board of Muslims of Kyrgyzstan, a   organisation, has slammed the ads as “provocative,” claiming that they undermine the unity of the Kyrgyz people. Some citizens have also shared images on social media critically comparing western clothes to hijabs and bemoaning the westernisation of Kyrgyz culture. But President Atambayev has long made it clear that he views the wearing of veils not as a sign of adherence to Islam but as evidence of Arab influence on the country. In 2014, speaking at a session of Kyrgyzstan’s Security Council, the President made it clear that he has no problem with conservative clothing, nor with Muslim traditions, but with the “Arabisation of society [and the] deprivation of the Kyrgyz nation of its language and traditions”. Burqas, niqabs and other veils are Saudi Arabian in origin their use has spread through the Muslim world along with the strict Wahhabi interpretation of Islam as promoted by groups including Islamic State."
39,"US, Japan conduct successful missile intercept",2017-02-06," (CNN) The US and Japan have passed a crucial test for missile defense, shooting down a   ballistic missile with a new interceptor launched from a   destroyer. The US Missile Defense Agency announced that the USS John Paul Jones detected, tracked and took out the target ballistic missile using its onboard Aegis Missile Defense System and a Standard   Block IIA interceptor. The test took place Friday night off the Hawaiian island of Kauai. ”Today’s test demonstrates a critical milestone in the cooperative development of the   Block IIA missile,” the director of the Missile Defense Agency, Vice Adm. Jim Syring, said in a statement.  ”The missile, developed jointly by a Japanese and US government and industry team, is vitally important to both our nations and will ultimately improve our ability to defend against increasing ballistic missile threats around the world.” The test came while new US Defense Secretary James Mattis was on his first overseas trip to South Korea and Japan. Ballistic missile defense was at the top of the agenda after North Korea’s prolific testing of   and   missiles last year.  And the US is worried that North Korea may be developing a   missile that could carry a nuclear warhead to reach as far as the US West Coast. A focus of Mattis’ trip was the THAAD    Terminal High Altitude Area Defense      system, which the US plans to deploy in South Korea this year. The THAAD system has drawn sharp criticism from China, which sees it as part of a broader US strategy to extend its military alliance network from Japan all the way down to the South China Sea. But during his trip to South Korea, Mattis said North Korea’s ”provocative behavior” was the only reason THAAD would be deployed. ”There is no other nation that needs to be concerned about THAAD other than North Korea,” he said. Though THAAD and Aegis operate on a similar concept, it’s THAAD that has drawn vocal Chinese opposition. Asked Monday about the Aegis system missile test, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said all such systems raised trust issues among the major military powers. ”Countries should not only consider their own security interests but also respect other countries’ security concerns” when it comes to missile defense, Lu said. ”We should follow the principles of preserving global strategic stability and doing no harm to other countries’ security.” The Aegis system is designed to intercept ballistic missile around the middle of their flight, when the missile is at its highest point above the Earth. The system is based on the powerful    radar, which can track 100 missiles simultaneously. The US Navy has 22   cruisers and 62   destroyers equipped with the Aegis system. Japan has six Aegis destroyers with plans for more. South Korea also operates   destroyers."

At least three people were killed and about 20 others were injured, police said. One of the dead is a    foreign worker, from Ukraine. Israel Defense Forces are leading the rescue effort and teams worked around the clock to locate and extract the construction workers. There’s no word on the cause of the collapse, and details of the investigation are under a   gag order. ”The ongoing effort consists of over 300 soldiers from the Search and Rescue battalion and the Canine Special Forces Unit,” IDF said.  Witness Sraya Listenberg said the implosion was so intense, it felt like an earthquake.  ”Everything fell down in one second,” he said.  The   underground parking garage was under construction when it gave way in a   area of northern Tel Aviv. The upper three floors imploded the lowest floor is believed to be about 50 feet underground. As rescue teams tried to find the trapped workers, authorities feared another collapse of the incomplete, unstable structure.  Listenberg said the disaster could have been more tragic. The garage collapsed during a lunch hour, when some construction workers were eating outside. ”They had lots of luck,” Listenberg said. "

43,Radical Pacifist Jesuit Priest Daniel Berrigan Dies at 94 - Breitbart,2016-05-01,"The Rev. Daniel Berrigan, a Jesuit priest famous for his   and   protests, died Saturday in New York at the age of 94. [Together with his younger brother, Philip, who was also a Catholic priest at the time, Berrigan was a leader of the radical   movement in the 1960s, and continued protesting against war for several decades.  Father Berrigan emerged as a radical Catholic voice against the Vietnam war in the 1960s and sprang into the spotlight in 1968 when he and several other activists seized 600 draft cards of troops about to be deployed in Vietnam and burned the files in rubbish bins with homemade napalm. The group of protesters, known as the “Catonsville Nine,” issued a declaration denouncing the Catholic Church and other religious bodies for their “cowardice” before America’s “crimes. ” We confront the Roman Catholic Church, other Christian bodies, and the synagogues of America with their silence and cowardice in the face of our country’s crimes. We are convinced that the religious bureaucracy in this country is racist, is an accomplice in this war, and is hostile to the poor. The Berrigan brothers were subsequently convicted of destroying government property, and sent to prison. Daniel ended up serving eighteen months in a federal penitentiary, during which time he and Philip appeared on the cover of Time magazine.  Other protests followed, leading to more arrests and prosecutions. From 1970 to 1995, Berrigan spent a total of nearly seven years in prison. In 1980, the Berrigans and six others broke into a General Electric nuclear missile site in Pennsylvania, sabotaging warhead nose cones and pouring blood onto documents and files. Berrigan also protested against the 1991 Gulf War, the Kosovo War, the U. S invasion of Afghanistan, the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and the prison in Guantánamo Bay. While focused against war and nuclear arms, Berrigan’s protests went beyond pacifism to embrace other causes as well. He believed that “racism and poverty, militarism and capitalist greed were interconnected pieces of the same big problem,” and he took part in protests against capitalism such as the Occupy Wall Street movement in New York’s Zuccotti Park. “The evils of capitalism,” Berrigan said, “are as real as the evils of militarism and the evils of racism. ” Parting ways with many of his friends on the left, however, Berrigan also protested abortion and was a vocal advocate of the   cause. “I have always made it clear,” he said, “that I am against everything from war to abortion to euthanasia. I have avoided being a   person. ” In a glowing   in the Jesuit magazine America, Berrigan is remembered as a “peacemaker” and a “prophet. ” Follow Thomas D. Williams on Twitter   Follow @   <!

44,Bernie Sanders’s Campaign Past Reveals Willingness to Play Hardball - The New York Times,2016-09-02,"During the 1986 race for governor of Vermont, Bernie Sanders bristled at the popularity of the Democratic incumbent, Madeleine Kunin. Mr. Sanders, who was running against her as an independent, saw himself as a leader, and viewed Ms. Kunin as a lightweight. “She does very well on television,” he told one interviewer. “She has an excellent press secretary. ” But really, he said another time, the governor’s appeal came down to one trait. “Many people are excited because she’s the first woman governor,” he said. “But after that, there ain’t much. ” Mr. Sanders has long presented himself as an     politician from rural New England, now seeking the presidency with promise of a political revolution. But his combative side has now emerged as the Democratic race has tightened and Hillary Clinton has sharpened her own rhetoric. The result is a far harsher tone in the Democratic campaign and a transformed Senator Sanders, who is now making the kinds of   attacks that some of his advisers regretted he did not deploy sooner. But his aggressiveness also worries some supporters who were powerfully drawn to his positive persona that forswore politics as usual. The senator’s assertiveness was on vivid display in Thursday’s debate with Mrs. Clinton ahead of the   New York primary on Tuesday, which Mr. Sanders must win big to dent Mrs. Clinton’s strong lead in the delegates needed for the nomination. But he is also seeking to match the vigorous jabs from her aides and allies, who ignored Mr. Sanders for much of last year and are now assailing his policy ideas and leadership abilities on a   basis. His advisers say he is reacting to the New York political environment as well. “Political combat is more restrained in places like Iowa and New Hampshire, but it’s completely different in New York, and Bernie has no problem defending his ideas in a tough way against Secretary Clinton’s,” said Tad Devine, a senior adviser for the Sanders campaign. Mrs. Clinton is now trying to hold off Mr. Sanders while not alienating his supporters, whom she would need in the general election. But she is also refusing to back down, and their spiky clashes are suddenly making for a more explosive and unpredictable race. More than anything, the recent Sanders broadsides reflect a political strategy he has carried out in previous campaigns: the use of blunt criticisms, sarcastic asides and a thundering style against his opponents. In the 1986 race, Mr. Sanders argued that he would be a strong feminist and do more for women than Ms. Kunin had. While granting that Ms. Kunin was “not corrupt,” he questioned if she had the same “courage” that he had. He repeatedly challenged her credentials as a fellow progressive, using some of the same language he aims at Mrs. Clinton. In the end, he damaged Ms. Kunin politically, as some Clinton supporters and political analysts think he may do in the current race. “In a tough fight, Bernie is hardly the     guy that he claims to be,” said Garrison Nelson, a longtime political science professor at the University of Vermont. Ms. Kunin was not the only foe that Mr. Sanders attacked with insinuations, as opposed to the more overtly negative television ads that Mr. Sanders has forsworn. In his 1990 race for Congress, he frequently laid political bait for his Republican opponent and relished watching him stumble. And in his 2006 Senate campaign, Mr. Sanders relentlessly linked his moderate Republican opponent with George W. Bush and Dick Cheney, and accused him of running “the most negative, dishonest campaign in the history of the state of Vermont. ” While such tactics are not unusual in many campaigns, Mr. Sanders has long tried to claim the high road. Yet if his past opponents remember anything about him, it’s Bernie the brawler. “The way he kept tagging me as a typical rich guy who only cared about rich Republicans  —   it was very tough, and very effective,” said Richard Tarrant, a software executive who was the Republican Senate nominee in 2006 and ran many aggressive television ads. “Bernie knew that I earned my money myself, that my wealth was  . But that didn’t matter. ” In the current race, after days of needling by the Clinton camp about his policies and ability to answer tough questions, Mr. Sanders hit back this month by saying Mrs. Clinton was “not qualified” for the presidency because she had taken money from wealthy donors and supported the war in Iraq and some   agreements. Some Sanders supporters expressed dismay that their candidate was resorting to such sharp exchanges  —   a Guardian columnist wrote on Tuesday that she felt “betrayed”  —   while the leading Republican candidate, Donald J. Trump, picked up the line of attack. “Bernie Sanders says that Hillary Clinton is unqualified to be president,” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. “Based on her decision making ability, I can go along with that!” Mr. Sanders has started running commercials in New York criticizing Mrs. Clinton for accepting   speaking fees from Wall Street banks but not supporting a federal $15 minimum wage. And in Thursday’s debate, he suggested that Mrs. Clinton’s speaking fees had influenced her to be soft on Wall Street regulation. She quickly dismissed that, saying that she had called out bankers over business practices  —   drawing a sarcastic response from Mr. Sanders. “Secretary Clinton called them out  —   oh my goodness, they must have been really crushed by this,” he said. “And was that before or after you received huge sums of money by giving speaking engagements? So they must have been very, very upset by what you did. ” While Mr. Sanders has not run   and highly personal ads against Mrs. Clinton  —   the sort that traditionally characterize a negative campaign  —   Mrs. Clinton’s advisers accused Mr. Sanders of breaking his word. “At times he does it deftly, but make no mistake, every day Senator Sanders is launching another attack, and that’s not how he said he would run his campaign,” said Joel Benenson, Mr. Clinton’s campaign strategist. Mr. Devine, a longtime strategist for Mr. Sanders, said his candidate’s quips and tone were a far cry from the   vitriol in the Republican race. He insisted that Mr. Sanders was seeking to reveal substantive differences with Mrs. Clinton, and denied that his candidate fears the Democratic nomination is slipping away. “I think the race is just increasingly engaged,” Mr. Devine said. In Vermont, however, Mr. Sanders was known for belittling opponents at times, rather than merely challenging their ideas. During one debate in the 1986 governor’s race, Mr. Sanders was asked if he viewed Governor Kunin as “the lesser of two evils,” given his descriptions of the Democratic and Republican parties as “Tweedledum” and “Tweedledee,” and if he thought he might contribute to her political “demise. ” Mr. Sanders chuckled and then looked at Ms. Kunin, seated a few feet away. “Governor, how does it feel to be the lesser of two evils?” he asked. “I think that really is what this campaign is about. ” Ms. Kunin was  . Toward the end of that campaign, Ms. Kunin said, Mr. Sanders argued at a rally in Burlington, Vt. that he would do far more for women than Ms. Kunin. “Bernie thought I was an empty suit, and insisted that he was the better feminist because he would solve income inequality and that would help women,” Ms. Kunin said in the interview. “He could be sarcastic, but also very subtle. ” A supporter of Mrs. Clinton’s presidential bid, Ms. Kunin said she saw similarities between his treatment of the two women. “He’s not going to say, ‘She’s a woman, she’s not qualified,’” said Ms. Kunin, who was   with 47 percent of the vote after Mr. Sanders siphoned off some support. “But he can paint a very subtle illusion talking about qualifications and judgment. ” Mr. Devine, the adviser to Mr. Sanders, said the senator would never make   attacks, in the 1980s or today. “His focus is on issues,” he said. Peter Smith, the Republican candidate for governor in 1986 and the congressman Mr. Sanders ousted in 1990, said that Mr. Sanders used passion to create “a contrast between him and his opponent that may not, in fact, exist. ” Mr. Sanders’s aides in the 1990 campaign said they would regularly taunt Mr. Smith about his positions on issues like the minimum wage, which the congressman would dispute, and then Mr. Sanders would come forward and accuse Mr. Smith of dishonesty. As a result, a running theme of that campaign was that Mr. Sanders had integrity and Mr. Smith lacked it. “The tool he uses is his intensity and his belief that, on the major issues he cares about, there is only one right answer,” Mr. Smith said. “And it is his. ”"

U. has made Democrats “jittery. ”  She said Saturday on MSNBC of Brexit, “There’s no doubt that this is making Democrats jittery to some extent. For example, if the economy here starts to stall, that could make voters more likely to choose Donald Trump, a Republican candidate, and, of course, there’s concerns that what happened in Europe underscores that there is a stronger than expected populous sentiment here in the U. S. Secretary Clinton trying to reach out to the populous in her own party. Of course, Senator [Bernie] Sanders still technically in the race. ” Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent"

47,’Never Trump’ Taps Their Candidate: Bald Unknown Mormon Hill Staffer from Goldman Sachs Who ‘Resettled’ Refugees for UN,2016-08-08,"With less than 100 days until the election, the Never Trump movement has fielded yet another independent presidential candidate to keep Republican nominee Donald Trump out of the White House. [This time their candidate is Evan McMullin. Here is what we know about him.  Candidacy Announced by Joe Scarborough, MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough broke the news of McMullin’s candidacy, dedicating two hours of his show on Monday to McMullin’s long shot bid. Scarborough also tweeted the news: BREAKING FIRST ON @Morning_Joe: Multiple sources say an independent conservative candidate will announce his candidacy for president today.  —   Joe Scarborough (@JoeNBC) August 8, 2016,  Multiple sources tell me the candidate is Evan McMullin. Wharton grad, CIA alum, Goldman Sachs, Republican Policy Director, US House,  —   Joe Scarborough (@JoeNBC) August 8, 2016,  McMullin’s official website went online this morning bearing what appears to be his campaign motto: “It’s never too late to do the right thing. And if we work together, there’s nothing we can’t achieve. ”  From CIA to Goldman Sachs to Republican Establishment, McMullin has never held elected office. According to his LinkedIn profile, from   he worked as an operations officer in the national clandestine service for the Central Intelligence Agency managing “clandestine operations related to counterterrorism, counterinsurgency, energy, political stability, and counterintelligence. ” He then went on to work as an investment banking associate for Goldman Sachs in San Francisco for three years. In 2013, he moved to Washington, D. C. to become the senior advisor to the House Committee on Foreign Affairs and then, two years later, the Chief Policy Director for the House Republican Conference, where he was responsible for advancing the policy agenda of the Republican leadership in the House. When John Boehner stepped down as Speaker, McMullin wrote on Facebook: “Today we learned that Congress will soon lose a tremendous leader in Speaker Boehner. ” Boehner’s ouster as Speaker was widely celebrated by grassroots conservatives as a victory for the Tea Party movement over the feckless and equivocating GOP leadership Boehner’s Speakership represented. However, McMullin had nothing but praise for Boehner as “one of the most humble, gracious, and savvy leaders I’ve ever encountered. ” McMullin said he was “grateful” for the opportunity “to learn” from Boehner. Former “Volunteer Refugee Resettlement Officer” and Fierce Critic of Trump’s Position on Muslim Migration  According to McMullin’s LinkedIn profile, he worked in 2001 as a “Volunteer Refugee Resettlement Officer” for the United Nations, where he “vetted and processed   refugees from the Middle East and Africa for resettlement to third countries. ” McMullin, who is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, is also a fierce critic of Trump’s call for a temporary ban on Muslim migration to the United States. He wrote on his Facebook page: “As Donald Trump continues attacking Muslims and as a former CIA officer, I’d like all Americans to know the truth: American and other Muslims have played a central role in virtually every counterterrorism win we’ve had since  . They are an indispensable asset in this fight. Attacking them as a group makes America weaker, not stronger. ” He has also posted on his Facebook page about the plight of Syrian refugees, linking to an Amnesty International article on refugees and noting: “Sobering facts: Over 50 million people around the world  —   including 50% of Syrians  —   have been forced from their homes due to conflicts in the worst global refugee crisis since WWII. ” Brainchild of Rick Wilson and Funded by Romney Donor, Joe Scarborough noted this morning that McMullin has “the backing of key $$ contributors in the Republican Party. ” The candidate revealed by sources  has an impressive resume and the backing of key $$ contributors in the Republican Party.  —   Joe Scarborough (@JoeNBC) August 8, 2016,  That’s no lie. One of the key Never Trump figures behind McMullin is none other than “  ” Rick Wilson, who last October declared that the GOP donor class must “put a bullet in Donald Trump” to stop him. Buzzfeed reports: “Sources said Wilson was in Washington on Sunday meeting with members of McMullin’s prospective campaign  —   which includes some who were involved in a group called Better for America, which has been pushing an independent presidential bid. ” As a 501( c)(4) organization, Better for America (BFA) can’t officially endorse a candidate even though it’s supporting McMullin’s bid. ABC News reports that the group “has been funded in part by John Kingston, a   conservative donor who bundled for Mitt Romney. ” Kingston also has ties to George W. Bush and John McCain, according to The Hill. The Hill reports that “several members of BFA have left the group so they can begin working on McMullin’s campaign or a supporting   seemingly putting him in position to benefit from their ballot access work. ” According to The Hill, among those working for McMullin: Republican pollster Joel Searby and conservative lawyer Mohammed Jazil have resigned from BFA to join McMullin’s campaign, a source said, while ballot access expert Kahlil Byrd and Democratic strategist Ileana Wachtel have left the group to launch a    . Narrow Path to Victory, McMullin’s path to victory is extremely narrow to  . Joe Scarborough noted that McMullin’s long shot campaign “has more to do with stopping Donald Trump than actually electing a president. ” The deadline for independent candidates to get on the November ballot has already passed in a number of states  —   including Texas with its large electoral count. However, Better for America is perhaps seeking to sue states like Texas to get on the ballot. The Hill notes that “to get into the presidential debates, a candidate must poll at 15 percent in five national surveys leading up to the three scheduled debates and show that they are appearing on enough state ballots to have a path to 270 electoral votes. ” At this late date, with more organized candidates like the Libertarian Party’s Gary Johnson and the Green Party’s Jill Stein struggling to reach the 15 percent margin, it’s hard to see how McMullin will make it onto the debate stage, and without that national platform, his candidacy will remain unknown to the majority of voters. A Mormon Candidate to Appeal to Mormon Voters in Utah, Arizona, and Idaho, McMullin is a Mormon and a graduate of Brigham Young University. Like Never Trump leader Mitt Romney, who served as a Mormon missionary in France, McMullin also did Mormon missionary work in a Catholic country. ABC News reports that McMullin was a missionary in Brazil, and his LinkedIn profile notes that he speaks Portuguese. It’s no secret that Donald Trump has a Mormon problem, as his polling in traditionally red states with large Mormon populations shows. The Huffington Post notes that McMullin’s candidacy could have the most impact in three such states: Utah, Arizona, and Idaho. In fact, the date of McMullin’s announcement comes just in time to make the August 15 deadline to get on the Utah ballot as an independent candidate. Utah’s election laws only require 1, 000 voter signatures for a candidate to be included on a ballot  —   a relatively easy number to achieve. Glenn Beck’s Never Trump Scheme at Play? During a July 27 radio interview with fellow Never Trump member Erick Erickson, Glenn Beck and his   articulated an ambitious scheme to run a third party candidate in red states that are not battleground states for Trump. The idea, which was explained by Beck’s   Stu Burguiere, is to have this independent candidate siphon off enough votes from Trump to keep Trump and Hillary Clinton under the threshold of 270 electoral votes needed to win the race outright, thereby throwing the election to the House of Representatives to decide the outcome, where they hope a Republican House will elect their independent candidate or another person who is not Trump. They suggested the candidate should be someone like Mitt Romney, but that was only because they couldn’t choose Paul Ryan due to his position as the Speaker of the House. (They assumed that Ryan was the ideal candidate for this scheme because presumably House Republicans would vote for him). Burguiere    said that “the will of the people is a serious problem with this” scheme because the people actually voted for Trump, but Beck, Erickson and their Never Trump compatriots apparently believe in thwarting democracy to save it from Trump. Though McMullin is not as ideal a candidate as Romney, he is a fellow Mormon who is hoping to challenge Trump in deep red states with large Mormon populations. Could McMullin’s long shot candidacy be a part of a more elaborate scheme to keep Trump and Hillary below 270 electoral votes and throw the election to the House? After all, keeping Trump under 270 is a lot easier than winning 270."
48,Harry Reid: Obama Nominating Scalia Replacement in ’A Little Over Three Weeks’ - Breitbart,2016-02-18,"On February 18, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid ( ) said President Obama will nominate a replacement for Antonin Scalia to the Supreme Court in “a little over three weeks. ”[According to Fox News, Reid met with Obama on Thursday then told MSNBC, “We’re going to have someone in the next few weeks. ” He then clarified, saying, “I think it will be a little over three weeks. ”  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( ) has already said he believes Scalia’s vacancy should be filled by the next president, and Republican presidential hopeful Ted Cruz said he is “absolutely” determined to filibuster any Supreme Court nominee put forward by Obama this year. Sen. Chuck Grassley ( ) released a statement on February 13  —   the day of Scalia’s death  —   in which he contended that the job of nominating a new Supreme Court justice belonged to the next president, rather than Obama. By February 16, he had modified his stance, telling Radio Iowa, “I would wait until the nominee is made before I would make any decisions. In other words, take it a step at a time. ” The Supreme Court is crucial to the survival of individual gun rights in America. With the death of Scalia, the court is now divided   on crucial decisions like District of Columbia v. Heller (2008) and McDonald v. Chicago (2010). The Heller ruling struck down D. C.’s gun ban as a violation of the individual right to keep and bear arms, and McDonald struck down Chicago’s gun ban on the grounds that Second Amendment rights are incorporated under the Fourteenth Amendment. Such incorporation means the Constitution not only protects gun rights from federal infringement but from state infringement as well.

49,This startup wants to turn crazy-popular unboxing videos into a new ’QVC for millennials’,2017-06-09,"’  ’ ’   The former CTO of Hulu wants to build a company that can change   how Generation Z shops on mobile, creating what he likes to call   a ”QVC for Millennials.”  ’ ”   Eric Feng’s plan is built around one thing that’s super   popular with  : Unboxing videos.  ” ’   ”It’s not just people opening up the packs, but user reviews and   comparisons, tutorials  —   the product review category is huge,”    said. ’ ’   On Thursday, Feng unveiled his new company, Packagd. The   startup plans to stream live video of the stars of unboxing   videos talking about new products. Consumers will be able to   watch the videos through Packagd’’s apps and will be able to buy   the products that are mentioned by just tapping on a ”add to   cart” button as the video plays.   ’ ’   Over the last year, Feng and his team have been working in   stealth to sign agreements with more than 20 YouTube stars   and strike partnerships with brands like Best Buy and Microsoft   to sponsor the videos. ’ ”   Packagd’s business plan consciously drew inspiration from QVC,   the cable channel where hosts showcased new products that viewers   could order by calling a number displayed on their screens. Many   placed their orders and many more watched just for the   entertainment. ” ’   The live product demos are a bid to bring back the joy of   shopping, something that Feng feels like has been stripped in the   internet era.  ’ ’   ”Ecommerce has gotten so efficient that it’s not fun anymore,”   said Feng, who is Packagd’’s CEO. ”People don’t window shop.   People don’t shop with their friends. Amazon is relentless about   minimizing the number of pages that you see before purchase.” ’ ’   He continued: ”For us, we want to bring discovery. We want you to   have fun while you’re shopping.” ’ ”   Feng, who is also a partner at venture capital firm Kleiner   Perkins, got the idea for Packagd   after learning  on YouTube. The top   5 unboxing channels on YouTube have over 33 million   subscribers combined, according to Feng’s Kleiner partner   Mary Meeker. ” ’   YouTube has to cater to all kinds of different video creators and   types of content. As popular as the unboxing videos have   become, they could do even better if a company focused solely on   them, Feng bet. ’ ”   So Feng and his team built Packagd to work just for     unboxers, . Feng thinks   Packagd can help them become as popular among young adults   on their mobile devices as QVC hosts have been among the   retirees glued to their TVs. And he’s banking that they can help   sell products much like the hosts have done on QVC and Home   Shopping Network. ” ’  ’ ’   ”We want you to discover not just videos for products you know   about, but videos for products you don’t know about. And have   those videos driving purchasing decisions,” Feng said. ’ ’   For its modern and mobile spin on QVC,  is starting with a six hour   block of live shows that it will stream through its app every   day.  ’ ’   These aren’’t intended to be the ”Buy! Buy! Buy! The clock is   ticking down!” style of infomercials you may see on TV. Instead,   Packagd is encouraging its new hosts to take a more informal   approach. They’’ll chat with viewers live while streaming the   unboxing videos they’’ve already uploaded to YouTube. Feng   hopes the effect will be more like interacting with a friendly   expert than hearing a   sales pitch. ’ ’   ”Unboxers we feel have cracked the code on this content type.   They created a content format that’s super interesting, super   engaging,” Feng said. ”We’re not asking them to create new   videos. We’re not asking them to adopt it for our platform. We’re   saying we want to showcase them in a different way.” ’ ’   The company is starting with a new app called Unboxed that   focuses on reviews of tech products, ranging from drones,   laptops to smart home devices. Packagd plans to follow   Unboxed with an app focused on beauty product reviews that it   hopes to launch in two months. After that will come a toy review   app.  ’ ”   During each live show, the host will field questions   from Unboxed users who will be able to submit them using a   chat feature in the app. Users will be able to buy whichever   products the hosts are touting via a purchase button at the   bottom of their screens. If they do, they’ll earn loyalty   points they can apply towards discounts on future purchases made   through Unboxed. ” ”   Such purchases will benefit the hosts as well; they’ll get   affiliate commissions. And they won’t have to share those with   Packagd. Instead, 100% of the affiliate revenue will go the   hosts, Feng said.  ” ”   Packagd plans to make money by convincing brands to pay   to sponsor certain time slots of its live streams. Those partners   could either work with a product reviewer to build a show or   create their own. Either way, Unboxed service will work the same   for users. They’ll  be able to ask hosts questions and buy   what they see.  ” ’   ”We want you to feel like you’re in the live QVC audience and   talking to the host,” Feng said. ”What drives a lot of   transactions on QVC is affinity with the host.” ’ ’   The company will offer users more to watch than just the six   hours of live, hosted videos. To accommodate users who may   not be interested in the product being touted at a particular   moment in the live stream, Unboxed will also   offer a library of   videos for a range of   products.  ’ ’  ’ ”   But Packagd’s apps will be missing something you normally find on   YouTube and on other video sites or apps: a search bar. That’s   intentional; Feng want to encourage users to browse products and   discover things serendipitously through the app rather than   accommodate shoppers who already know what they want to buy. ” ’   ”You don’t turn on QVC when you know you want the DJI Spark,”   Feng said.  ’ ”   Despite Feng’s conviction that mobile shopping can be   transformed, he acknowledges the challenge Packagd faces. ” ’  ’ ”   While the company’s been able to convince product reviewers to   host its video stream, it will have to lure in consumers too, and   they may be harder to attract. If they’re already watching   product videos on YouTube or finding products on Instagram,   they may not see the need to download a new app to get similar   information.  ” ’   (Packagd plans to use product giveaways and a physical booth   at the electronics show, E3, to convince them to give the app a   try.) ’ ’   Still, Feng is hopeful that if Packagd builds something   better for both unboxers and consumers, success will follow.   The company has already raised $7. 5 million from top Silicon   Valley venture capitalists, who are betting it will do for   unboxing videos what Twitch did for gaming. ’ ”   Even though YouTube is the dominant player today, it’s investing   too widely and not focusing enough on translating its popularity   into purchases, Feng said. That’s where there’s an opening for   Packagd, he added.  ” ’   ”I’m hoping the fact that these videos are so popular means there   is demand to consume them. I think the bigger existential   question is does that demand to consume those just stay on   YouTube?” Feng said. ”It may. We may not be able to pull it off.   That may be a real competitive risk that we just can’t solve. But   we won’t know until we launch and try.”  ’ ’The former CTO of Hulu wants to build a company. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’"
50,"More Than 200 MS-13 Members Reside in Long Island, FBI Says",2017-04-26,"There are more than 200 members of the violent, El Salvadorian   gang in the Long Island, New York area, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. [The FBI’s Long Island Gang Task Force Director Geraldine Hart told NBC New York in an interview that members of   “bolster their ranking among other gangs by using violence. ”  Hart told the media that the   gang problem, specifically as its members are usually illegal immigrants, is a national issue across the U.

51,Congress barely meets DHS deadline,2015-02-26,"Washington (CNN) The House approved a   extension of funding for the Department of Homeland Security,  avoiding a partial shutdown just hours before a Friday night deadline.  President Barack Obama signed the bill, which funds the Department of Homeland Security until March 6.  The bill does nothing to resolve the central issue that has turned the agency’s funding into a political football: immigration. Republicans will again push to tie money for DHS to legislation rolling back Obama’s immigration orders. Senate Democrats will block that effort, ensuring another tumultuous week on Capitol Hill and more uncertainty for the hundreds of thousands of people who work at DHS. There was already plenty of drama in Congress on Friday. Earlier in the day, the House rejected a bill that would have kept DHS open for three weeks, a shocking twist that renewed questions about Speaker John Boehner’s grip on the House. Rep. Steve Womack,   who is close to House leadership, described House Speaker John Boehner’s situation as like a ”vice.” ’Hell of a position’ ”It’s a hell of a position to be in,” Womack said Friday evening. ”I just can’t imagine the frustration the speaker must have now.” READ: What happens if DHS shuts down? Two senior House Republican sources tell CNN there was serious concern among those close to the Speaker that if he allowed a vote on a clean DHS funding bill without immigration language, conservatives would make a motion to vacate the chair, which amounts to a direct challenge to his job. Pennsylvania GOP Rep. Charlie Dent acknowledged to reporters he heard conservatives were using the DHS fight to try to remove Boehner. ”Right now, we have to get serious,” he said. ”I think a lot of people better get serious about governing and it’s time for all of these, you know, DC games to end. I mean all these palace coups or whatever the hell is going on around here has to end, and we have to get down to the business of governing.” The battle over DHS funding comes more than 16 months after political chaos tipped the entire government into a shutdown. Republicans bore the brunt of the public’s blame for that episode and polls indicate the party would be blasted again. A CNN poll last week found 53% of Americans would blame Republicans in Congress if the department shuts down, while 30% would blame Obama. Another 13% said both would deserve the blame. Boehner has been here before    wedged between his   flank and the Senate. House conservatives want to continue fighting to block Obama’s actions on immigration and want to go to conference with the Senate to work out their differences . Implications for Boehner, How he handles the showdown could dictate the rest of his speakership, as House conservatives warn compromising now means he’s effectively allowing Democrats to block GOP agenda for the next two years.  The Senate approved a   funding bill Friday even though it wasn’t expected to go anywhere in the House. On a   bipartisan vote, the Senate cleared a   ”clean” DHS bill, after stripping of provisions opposed by Democrats that would have blocked Obama’s immigration orders. Even as he and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell deployed completely different strategies to address the impending funding lapse, Boehner insisted the GOP is on the same page. ”It is not a fight amongst Republicans. All Republicans agree we want to fund the Department of Homeland Security and we want to stop the President’s executive action with regard to immigration,” he said. Court ruling, Some Senate Republicans are urging the House to point to the recent ruling by a Texas judge to suspend the administration’s program to process visas for those wanting to remain in the country. ”The courts have acted. Accept the victor that the courts have given us, which is the President does not have the authority to do what he has done and vote to continue to fund the Department of Homeland Security. I think that is the right decision,” Sen. John Barasso,   said on CNN on Thursday. Some conservatives have said they don’t feel any pressure to fund the agency before the deadline because most employees would still be required to come to work. Rep. Tim Huelskamp,   told CNN that employees at the agency just got paid last week so there is enough time to debate the issue before they need to approve continued funding, even on a short term basis. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson dismissed that notion and told reporters ”that minimizes the impact of forcing people to work without a paycheck” and said he continues to press for ”full funding.”"
52,British Decision on Nuclear Plant Angers China and France - The New York Times,2016-08-02,"LONDON  —   The decision of the new British government to postpone a deal on a nuclear power station, to be built by France with major Chinese investment, has shocked both of those countries and is a potentially major step away from the policies of former Prime Minister David Cameron. The sudden choice of Prime Minister Theresa May not to sign the deal but to take until the autumn for further study, reportedly on security and economic grounds, has angered both Paris, which will be crucial to Britain’s future relations with the European Union after the country’s vote to leave the bloc, and Beijing, which Mr. Cameron had cultivated aggressively for investment and trade ties despite criticism that he was subordinating human rights and geopolitical concerns to commerce. The menu had already been published for a grand lunch after a signing ceremony last Friday on the Somerset coast, the site of the proposed Hinkley Point C nuclear power station, which is designed to produce 3, 200 megawatts with two new French reactors at a cost of at least 18 billion pounds, about $23. 7 billion. The day before, the board of the largely   EDF, the French power utility, voted 10 to 7 to approve Hinkley Point, despite serious concerns about the ability of the company to handle the project and its costs. But late Thursday night, Downing Street said it would not sign the deal the next day as planned. Travel by French and Chinese officials to Somerset for the party was canceled, and the “hoi sin local lamb skewers” and mackerel ceviche had to be abandoned. While Downing Street said that Mrs. May had told President François Hollande of France the week before that she would postpone the deal, the board of EDF was taken by surprise.   Lévy, the company’s chief executive, said he had been unaware of the British hesitation before the board’s vote and found out about it during a newspaper interview. Mrs. May told Mr. Hollande that her new government wanted to look at the deal again, as any new government would. But since then it has become clear that her main concerns are with the Chinese involvement, and she seemed to be signaling an end to the British willingness to be China’s best Western ally in return for Chinese investment. Having served as home secretary for six years before becoming prime minister, Mrs. May is security minded and had expressed concerns in cabinet meetings during the Cameron administration about bringing Beijing into such a sensitive project. The project is meant to provide about 7 percent of Britain’s electricity needs. She was also reported to have been unhappy on security grounds when British Telecom agreed to a deal with the Chinese telecommunications company Huawei. While China is funding just over a third of the Hinkley Point project, the real advantage for Beijing is that the deal offers China a chance to build and operate a nuclear power plant of its own design at another site in Britain, at    in Essex. That reportedly troubles Mrs. May because it could give China control over an important part of Britain’s energy supply. On Monday, China reacted angrily to suggestions that its investment in the project threatened British security. The official Xinhua news agency published a commentary arguing that the delay “adds uncertainties to the ‘Golden Era’ of  . K. ties” and suggesting that further Chinese investment in Britain could be rethought. “China can wait for a rational British government to make responsible decisions, but cannot tolerate any unwanted accusation against its sincere and benign willingness for   cooperation,” the commentary said. Mr. Cameron and his chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, had made a big pitch for closer economic and   ties with China, including a   state visit last October by President Xi Jinping. The British decision in March 2015 to become the first Western country to join China’s rival to the World Bank, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, shocked the Obama administration. The Hinkley Point C project is still expected to go ahead at this point, especially given the added British jobs. But Mrs. May could try to alter China’s role. The delay was interpreted as a message to Beijing and Washington that her position toward China is more skeptical than that of Mr. Cameron and Mr. Osborne, who had aspirations of becoming prime minister but whom she fired from government. On Monday, Helen Bower, a spokeswoman for Mrs. May, said that Britain did not want a break with Beijing. “With the role China has to play on world affairs, on the global economy, on a whole range of international issues, we are going to continue to seek a strong relationship with China,” she said. As for France, Mr. Hollande has near record disapproval ratings in the polls and faces elections in May. He has pushed for EDF to win the project as a needed lift for the country’s nuclear industry, which has suffered since the disaster at Fukushima in Japan. This   pressurized water reactor is complex, and the company has experienced construction problems and severe cost overruns as it tries to finish the first ones in Finland and Flamanville, France. EDF unions, some board members, engineers and senior executives have expressed deep reservations over the financial risks the construction of the reactor entailed for the indebted power company."

[The officer pressed the panic button on her   camera after being dispatched to a garden party in a picturesque Cambridgeshire village at around 10pm on Thursday and overhearing a song being played that mocked Osama Bin Laden. Responding to the call for help, the local force dispatched another ten officers and a police helicopter, Cambridge News reports.  It is alleged that in addition to the parody song making fun of the dead terrorist,   were also shouting “  abuse” a suggestion the partygoers deny. Mark Donovan, who attended the party in the Cambridge village  —   which dates back to the time of the Domesday Book  —   spoke to the paper after the incident, and said: “We was having a summer’s evening in my neighbour’s garden as we don’t have one. We had our karaoke machine on playing music through our phones from YouTube which are all approved songs. “It was about 10pm and the music may have been a little loud but it was before 11pm. Someone must have made a complaint, and a police officer attended our address, at which time a song from YouTube called the Bin Laden Song came on. “This police officer said she took offence at the song and pressed her panic button on her body cam and that’s when about ten police turned up and the police helicopter. “They are now investigating it as a racist crime. It is ridiculous. ” Police have seized the karaoke machine.  "
54,Mark Tapson: Trump’s Big Agenda: David Horowitz’s New Book Lays Out the Plan,2017-01-16,"After eight years of treasonous subversion by Barack Obama’s radical administration to fundamentally transform the United States, Donald Trump’s election victory is galvanizing a revival of American exceptionalism. But Trump and his team face formidable opponents as they begin the Herculean task of reversing the course of Obama’s failed presidency: not only a vengefully determined left but an entrenched Republican establishment in Washington D. C. and a stubborn contingent of Never Trumper politicians and pundits. [David Horowitz’s new book, Big Agenda: President’s Trump’s Plan to Save America  —   the first major book to be released on Trump’s presidency  —   lays out a strategy for combating those opponents of the  ’s conservative restoration.   The founder of the David Horowitz Freedom Center, the left’s most hated apostate, and the right’s most aggressive strategist, Horowitz reveals major components of Trump’s plan for his first 100 days and his   agenda in the slim but essential Big Agenda (available Tuesday, January 17 from Humanix Books). The book has earned unqualified support from the likes of Dinesh D’Souza, gay conservative firebrand Milo Yiannopoulos, Clinton Cash author Peter Schweizer, Rush Limbaugh (who calls the book “a road map for a winning agenda that conservatives will embrace”) and Ann Coulter, who recommends it as a “brilliant battle plan. ” Horowitz begins by profiling the adversaries. “[T]he first concern of Americans disturbed by the radicalism of the Obama years,” he declares, is the division within the Republican party itself. For eight years the Republican Party mustered only tepid opposition to President Obama. This was a party made feckless by its incomprehension of the nature of the left, by a failure of nerve, and by a lack of the will to win. Then Trump barreled onto the scene with a readiness to “disregard the politically correct restraints on public discourse” and to “relentlessly attack” Democrats who could dish it out but were unaccustomed to having it thrown back at them. As a result, the “passions Trump aroused in the electorate sparked a revolt in the Republican Party” and thrust the political outsider ahead of his 16 rivals in the primaries and then on to election victory against Hillary Clinton.   Beyond the sharp division that still remains in his own party, Trump and his supporters face the   zealots of an ideology fueled by ugly, dehumanizing hatred for anyone who stands in the way of their utopian vision  —   a hatred exemplified in Hillary’s demonization of conservatives as “irredeemable deplorables”: racists, sexists, Islamophobes, homophobes, xenophobes  —   “you name it,” she said on the campaign trail. Trump fearlessly identified that hatred during the second presidential debate when he told the audience that “Hillary has tremendous hatred in her heart. ” Republicans have been playing defense for so long that Trump’s willingness to publicly characterize progressives for what they are, Horowitz notes with admiration, “was probably unprecedented in the annals of modern presidential politics. ” Horowitz realized correctly that Trump was the only Republican who had a chance against Hillary. In Part Two of the book Horowitz identifies the leftist agenda, the overarching goal behind the issues, that Trump and the right must understand and counter. He points to Saul   progressives like Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton as evidence that the Democratic Party “has moved so far to the left in recent decades that it now operates on the sixties’ principle that the issues it advances are mere stepping stones on the way to more radical changes. ” Those changes mean the dismantling of individual freedom and the consolidation of power in the hands of the state. That explains the left’s drive to establish a totalitarian infrastructure through their obsessive push for the passage of Obamacare, their religious devotion to save the planet from   “climate change” (which they deem a greater threat to national security than terrorism) their social justice solutions to what they insist against all evidence is America’s “systemic racism,” and their globalist pursuits, which include lawless Sanctuary Cities, open borders policies, and a willful blindness toward our Islamic fundamentalist enemy. Horowitz breaks down all of these issues to demonstrate how they are central to the left’s   agenda.  Part Three, approximately half the book, presents Horowitz’s strategy for the way forward. “The goal,” he begins, “is to put Democrats on the offensive  …     to expose their hypocrisy and turn their firepower against them  …     The strategy is to go for the jugular. ” Conservatives generally are uncomfortable with the idea of political brawling, even when on the ropes as they have been throughout the Obama years. But Horowitz stresses that if your first response to, say, the left’s kneejerk use of the race card is to go on the defensive, then you are losing. “To turn around the political battles conservatives have been losing for so long, they must begin every confrontation by punching progressives in the mouth,” he declares, referring to boxer Mike Tyson’s famous observation that “everybody has a game plan until you punch them in the mouth. ” Donald Trump is better suited to pursuing such a strategy than any Republican leader in recent memory. Horowitz goes on to note that the right must attack the left with equal moral force, particularly at the Democrats’ Achilles heel: their atrocious record on race as exemplified in their monopoly control of America’s inner cities and the suffering and misery they have wrought there. Conservatives must also attack progressives for what Horowitz calls their wars on men and women, their leftist indoctrination in our schools, their politicized   institutions such as the progressive Ford Foundation, their powerful, thuggish government unions, and their corruption and foreign influence peddling. And the right must destroy the false narrative that the Democratic Party is the party of the people. In short, the right must, as one chapter title puts it, “go on the attack and stay on it. ” We must be as willing to morally stigmatize the left as they are us. We must fight fire with fire. And then we must take things a step further “and create a unifying theme that has a moral resonance” with which we can level the political playing field. “That theme is individual freedom”: The New Republicanism must be a movement opposed to the progressives’ sellout of American sovereignty, of America’s historical uniqueness. It must be unapologetic in its patriotism and in its commitment to rebuilding America economically and militarily. Third, the New Republicanism must show its contempt for a political correctness that denies the virtues of America’s culture, which is founded on individual rights and equality before the law. It must oppose progressive “multiculturalism,” which seeks to replace this culture with   hierarchies of gender, class, and race. “This is the moral language Republicans need to use if they are going to defeat the progressive agenda,” Horowitz insists. He concludes the book with a battle plan for the first 100 days that includes such recommendations as restoring Guantanamo, moving our embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, defunding sanctuary cities, promoting energy independence, nixing illegal immigration amnesty, attacking IRS malfeasance, dismantling Obamacare, and following through on Trump’s promise of a New Deal for black America. “No president since FDR and his famed ‘100 Days’ has the chance Donald Trump has,” David Horowitz has said, to reshape the American political landscape at home and abroad  —   if conservatives understand the nature of the enemy we face and how to engage them successfully.  Big Agenda succinctly educates the right about that enemy and maps a clear way forward to victory and restoration.

55,"In Pennsylvania, Unbound Delegates Remain Wary of Donald Trump - The New York Times",2016-04-28,"PHILADELPHIA  —   Mary Ann Meloy, one of the 54 Republican delegates elected in Pennsylvania on Tuesday as free agents to the Republican National Convention, said she would find it very hard to vote for Donald J. Trump. Ms. Meloy had a sister with cerebral palsy. And Mr. Trump’s disparaging treatment of people with disabilities, she said, “made me want to jump through the television screen. ” Because of the unusual latitude the Pennsylvania Republican Party gives to the delegates like Ms. Meloy who are not required to support any candidate, Mr. Trump’s crushing victory in the state on Tuesday is more complicated than it may appear. “The bottom line is that being an uncommitted delegate gives you the ability to take all the facts into consideration,” said Ms. Meloy, who lives in Harmar Township outside Pittsburgh and got her start in politics volunteering for Richard M. Nixon in 1968. “Certainly the will of the people in your district  —   there’s a lot to be said for that. ” But, she continued: “We have a representative form of government. Not a democracy. A representative democracy. ” Mr. Trump won Pennsylvania with nearly 57 percent of the vote. He carried every county, including Ms. Meloy’s, and even won large urban ones with diverse and highly educated populations like Philadelphia, the kind of territory that he has often found inhospitable to his rancorous brand of politics. Yet in the trench warfare fight for the Republican presidential nomination  —   the smaller, less understood delegate races that could prove far more pivotal to Mr. Trump’s campaign  —   the situation remains fluid. He appeared to have won about 40 of Pennsylvania’s 54 unbound delegates, along with another 17 awarded to him outright as the statewide winner. The remaining 14 delegates have either expressed no preference or said they would not vote for Mr. Trump. Should Mr. Trump fall short of receiving a majority of the delegates he needs to secure the nomination before the convention  —   an outcome that seems less likely after Tuesday but still looms as a possible spoiler  —   a small number of unbound delegates could make all the difference. From a former congressman turned lobbyist in Erie to a gastroenterologist in Philadelphia, the uncommitted, unbound delegates chosen in Pennsylvania’s 18 congressional districts to represent the state at the national convention in July were examples of just how unpredictable and counterintuitive the nominating process can be. Completely untethered from the public opinion, the delegates who are unbound under state party rules could find themselves grappling with a number of concerns in a contested convention, both political and personal, many of which have nothing to do with the preferences of the voters who elected them. Together, Pennsylvania’s 54 unbound delegates will form the largest group of free agents when Republicans meet in Cleveland in July. And if the vote is close, the nominee could rise or fall on the Pennsylvania Republican Party’s experiment with political free will. Many newly elected Trump delegates find this maddening. “How do you justify not voting for him at the convention? What rationale could people possibly have?” asked Lynne Ryan, who lives in New Castle, in the state’s northwest corner along the Ohio border. “But people will find a reason. Trust me. ” Ms. Ryan, a topsoil farmer and flight attendant, campaigned as a committed Trump supporter. But at least one of the other delegates elected from her area, Phil English, a former congressman, has been wary of Mr. Trump. In few states are the quirks of the American party system as evident as in Pennsylvania, which delivered only 17 of its 71 delegates outright to the winner of its primary, Mr. Trump. The remaining 54 delegates were elected blindly by voters in each of the state’s 18 congressional districts. The only way voters knew if they were voting for a delegate who supported their favored presidential candidate was if they went to the trouble of educating themselves. That information was not printed on the ballot. And in some cases it was not knowable at all, because many delegate candidates ran saying they would not commit to any candidate now. “The campaign is fluid,” said Bob Bozzuto, executive director of the Pennsylvania Republican Party, recounting his conversations with delegate candidates recently who have said they wanted to leave themselves some flexibility. “We talk to some who have been recruited by a campaign and say ‘I’m going to vote for the candidate I’m signed up to vote for,’” he said. “You have some others,” he added, “who say, ‘the time between April 26 and July 18 might cause me to have some conversations, and I’ll see what happens. ’” Determining how many Pennsylvania delegates are solidly for Mr. Trump, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas or Gov. John Kasich of Ohio is complicated, given that personal preferences can shift so quickly. The New York Times interviewed delegates, analyzed lists of the campaigns’ preferred delegate candidates and relied on media reports to arrive at its totals. But Mr. Trump hopes to prevail on the unbound delegates by sheer force. He has been making an impassioned case that he deserves the nomination because he has a wide leads in the popular vote, and should not be denied the nomination if he falls just short of a majority at the convention. His underperformance in some states to Mr. Cruz has left him short of that majority, and on Tuesday, the Texas senator appeared to pick up only a few delegates in Pennsylvania. The Times’s analysis counted only three. By framing his possible loss as a denial of popular will and a power grab by the establishment, Mr. Trump has frustrated efforts by Republicans who have tried to hold him back and push the convention into multiple rounds of balloting, an outcome that could very well result in the nomination of someone more palatable to party loyalists. But the overwhelming margin of Mr. Trump’s win in Pennsylvania shows that delegates buck the results at their own peril. Some were slowly coming to this realization. “I want to do the right thing,” said Mr. English, a former congressman who was elected as a delegate on Tuesday representing the northwestern corner of the state. He said he has reservations about Mr. Trump’s ability to unite the party and wants to spend more time thinking about his decision. But he said he ultimately could not foreclose voting for Mr. Trump given how well he did in his district. “The expectation had been that Trump would be staying below 50 percent. That clearly is not the dynamic that’s out there,” he said, adding, “That’s loomed very large in my thought process. ” In Pennsylvania, long relegated to the role of political footnote in the nominating process because it holds its primary so late in the cycle, a victory has not been important to Republicans since 1980, when George Bush’s victory in the state revived his campaign against Ronald Reagan. But this year Pennsylvania Republicans could find themselves the center of a contested convention, much as they were in 1976 when Mr. Reagan made an   bid to overcome President Gerald R. Ford by naming Richard Schweiker, a Pennsylvania senator, as his running mate. The move did not, however, impress Pennsylvania delegates, or many other delegates for that matter. Mr. Reagan lost on the first ballot. “These delegates are all trying to dance,” said Representative Charlie Dent, a Republican who represents the Lehigh Valley. “On the one hand they say they want to support the district. But they all have their own preferences. And they will come under tremendous pressure from all the candidates. And not just the candidates but party leaders and elected officials. ” Seth Kaufer, a Philadelphia gastroenterologist elected as a delegate on Tuesday, said he has already met personally with Mr. Cruz and Carly Fiorina, who worked on the Texas senator’s delegate outreach team before becoming his running mate on Wednesday. He also met Mr. Kasich. The one candidate he has not met is Mr. Trump. For now, Dr. Kaufer said, he is waiting to decide which one to support at the convention in Cleveland. Hearing from Mr. Trump’s team  —   or their highly motivated supporters  —   now seems all but certain, whether Dr. Kaufer welcomes it or not. Mr. Trump carried Philadelphia County with almost 60 percent of the vote."

58,No Need for Holmes. Obama Sheds Light on a Winston Churchill Mystery. - The New York Times,2016-04-25,"HANOVER, Germany  —   It has been, perhaps, one of the most enduring mysteries of President Obama’s tenure: What really happened to the bust of Winston Churchill that was once displayed in the Oval Office? With just months left in his term, Mr. Obama’s first comments on the matter, in Europe last week, may have finally cleared up the truth of a tale that has persisted for more than seven years. For conservatives in both America and Britain, the disappearance of the bust from its place of honor soon after the end of George W. Bush’s presidency was  evidence of a liberal snub by Mr. Obama. In their view, he clearly did not fully appreciate the greatness of the British prime minister, who served during and after World War II. (The bust was replaced, White House officials said at the time, with one of Abraham Lincoln.) The conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer, the onetime Republican presidential contender Mike Huckabee and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, a current Republican presidential candidate, are among those who have chastised Mr. Obama over the years for returning the bust to the British. Less than a month after Mr. Obama’s first inauguration in 2009, a British newspaper bluntly accused him of sending “Sir Winston Churchill packing. ” Not true, the White House insisted at the time, offering various explanations. William Allman, the White House curator, said in a 2010 interview with CBS News that the bust, on loan to Mr. Bush by Tony Blair, the former British prime minister, “was already scheduled to go back” before Mr. Obama took office. The bust was returned “as a matter of course” by the new administration along with other art that had been on loan to Mr. Bush for display during his term in office, White House officials said. Dan Pfeiffer, the president’s communications director at the time, blasted Mr. Krauthammer, calling his charge about the disappearing bust “100 percent false” and saying that “news outlets have debunked this claim time and again. ” In a blog post labeled a “fact check” on the White House website, Mr. Pfeiffer wrote: “The bust still in the White House. In the Residence. Outside the Treaty Room. ” Mr. Pfeiffer later apologized to Mr. Krauthammer after admitting that the bust outside the Treaty Room was, in fact, a different Churchill bust, given to President Lyndon B. Johnson in the 1960s. Still, Mr. Pfeiffer insisted, the return of the Oval Office bust was “not something that President Obama or his administration chose to do” and was not “a symbol of President Obama’s failure to appreciate the special relationship. ” But late last week, Boris Johnson, the mayor of London, renewed the charge, writing in a British tabloid that the Oval Office bust had been “banished” and suggesting that it could be “a symbol of the   president’s ancestral dislike of the British Empire  —   of which Churchill had been such a fervent defender. ” Countering such charges is typically left to a president’s aides. But asked at a news conference Friday about the mayor’s comments, Mr. Obama seemed to relish the chance to set everyone straight, once and for all, about the fate of the Churchill bust. The president started by explaining that when it came to Churchill, “I love the guy. ” He offered as proof the Churchill bust that sits outside the Treaty Room, the president’s private office on the second floor of the White House residence, not far from the first family’s living quarters. “I see it every day, including on weekends, when I’m going into that office to watch a basketball game,” he said. “The primary image I see is a bust of Winston Churchill. It’s there voluntarily, because I can do anything on the second floor. I love Winston Churchill. ” But then Mr. Obama went on to explain what had happened to the bust lent by Mr. Blair, the one that critics had accused him of summarily sending back to the British. It was, Mr. Obama said, his decision to return that Churchill to his native land, because he wanted to replace it with a bust of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. “There are only so many tables where you can put busts. Otherwise, it starts looking a little cluttered,” the president explained. “And I thought it was appropriate, and I suspect most people here in the United Kingdom might agree, that as the first   president, it might be appropriate to have a bust of Dr. Martin Luther King in my office. ” He added that the choice of Dr. King was “to remind me of all the hard work of a lot of people who would somehow allow me to have the privilege of holding this office. ” That appears to contradict the longstanding denials by White House officials, including Mr. Pfeiffer, that neither Mr. Obama nor anyone else in his administration had chosen to dispatch Churchill’s likeness in favor of someone else’s. By Mr. Obama’s admission, he made the decision to replace the Churchill bust with one of Dr. King. “I think people should know my thinking there,” Mr. Obama told the reporters in London. Mystery solved. Except for one thing: The version of events in which Lincoln had replaced Churchill was mentioned in most stories about the issue (including in this paper). Mr. Pfeiffer included news reports about it in his 2012 blog post attacking Mr. Krauthammer. “The A. P. reported that President Obama ‘replaced the Oval Office fixture with a bust of one of his American heroes, President Abraham Lincoln,’ ” he wrote. Mr. Pfeiffer no longer works for Mr. Obama he is now vice president of communications and policy for GoFundMe, a website that helps its users raise money for causes. Current White House officials said the Churchill bust had been replaced with one of Dr. King, but the Oval Office still has a Lincoln bust as well, perhaps leading to the confusion. After all, one White House official noted, Mr. Obama did say the Oval Office could get a little cluttered."
59,Man headed to LA gay-pride parade with guns and explosives in his car: ’I wish I could kill a lot of people’,2016-06-15,"’  ’ ’   LOS ANGELES (AP)   An Indiana man was charged Tuesday with three   felony weapons violations after authorities say they found three   assault rifles and explosive chemicals in his car before a major   Los Angeles gay pride parade. ’ ’   James Wesley Howell, 20, made his first appearance in Los Angeles   County Superior Court, where a lawyer entered not guilty pleas on   his behalf to charges of possessing an assault weapon, possessing   a destructive device on a public street, and importing or   manufacturing a large magazine. ’ ’   He also was charged with a misdemeanor count of possessing a   loaded firearm in a vehicle. ’ ’   A judge set bail at $2 million, saying Howell poses ”a   significant public safety danger.” ’ ’   A federal investigation of Howell was ongoing, said Laura   Eimiller, an FBI spokeswoman in Los Angeles. ’ ’   Howell was arrested Sunday in Santa Monica, when police say the   weapons and explosives were found in a car he apparently drove   from Indiana. Howell told police he was headed to a gay pride   event in West Hollywood that attracts hundreds of thousands of   people. ’ ”   It’s unclear whether Howell intended any violence at the LA Pride   event, but the timing of the arrest   hours after the massacre at   a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida   put police and event   organizers on heightened alert. ” ’   Not too much can be inferred at this point simply because Howell   only faces state charges, said Rebecca Lonergan, a former federal   prosecutor who teaches national security law at the University of   Southern California. ’ ’   If no charges had been filed by Tuesday, authorities would have   had to release Howell. The state charges allow him to be held   while federal investigators continue their probe, Lonergan said. ’ ’   ”In the atmosphere we have where there is such great concern   about active shooters, about terrorism, about hate crimes, both   the state and federal investigators are going to want to   thoroughly look at this guy,” she said. ’ ”   Federal agents searched Howell’s Jeffersonville, Indiana, home on   Monday but declined to release any details. ” ”   On Tuesday, the sheriff’s office in Clark County, Indiana, said   Howell also is the subject of a sexual assault investigation.

60,House Freedom Caucus set to unveil Obamacare repeal and replace plan ,2017-02-07," (CNN) Members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus are developing their own legislation to repeal and replace Obamacare and plan to unveil it as early as next week. Rep. Mark Meadows,   Carolina told reporters the proposal currently being drafted takes much of the language from a 2015 GOP measure to dismantle the health care law that Congress passed but was vetoed by   Barack Obama. ”It echoes a repeal and a replacement at the same time.” Hill Republicans have struggled in recent weeks to get on the same page for how they plan to roll back Obamacare and create a new system, while still addressing concerns from voters about disruptions in insurance coverage during a transition period.  This latest effort will add pressure on leaders from those on the right, who have expressed frustration with the lack of more immediate action on a central 2016 campaign promise. President Donald Trump added to the confusion over the weekend when he told Fox News that his effort to get rid of the law and stand up a new health care system could spill into next year. ”We’re going to be putting it in fairly soon, I think that    yes, I would like to say by the end of the year at least the rudiments but we should have something within the year and the following year,” Trump said. South Carolina Rep. Mark Sanford is taking the lead on the new legislation, taking input from Freedom Caucus members and others and putting them into legislative language. The group met Monday evening to go over the framework and is likely to endorse the measure. It will take some elements of a proposal already introduced by Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, who has argued that both efforts    rolling back the law and creating a new system    need to happen simultaneously. Meadows stressed that the measure will protect coverage for those with   conditions and said another focus was ”making sure costs go down.” Conservatives plan to push for a vote on their bill alongside the Republican leadership’s reconciliation package that is being constructed now by key committees. Meadows said action on both doesn’t necessarily need to be simultaneous, but ”certainly needs to be the same week.”  The North Carolina Republican suggested that because states are split on how to address those getting coverage through the Medicaid program that the new legislation would likely propose allocating funds through block grants and letting states administer the programs on their own. Vice President Mike Pence attended a lunch in the Capitol Tuesday with another group of House conservatives, the Republican Study Committee, to reassure members that the Administration was in fact on the same page with moving swiftly ahead with its top legislative priority. RSC Chairman Mark Walker, who introduced the first GOP health care bill last month, told CNN that Pence reiterated to members in that meeting that ”regardless of how it was articulated on O’Reilly or over the weekend, that they are committed to moving quickly with this.” Walker, a former pastor who is in his second term in Congress, downplayed any mixed messages on the process from the president. ”I think like I did, coming from a background without any kind of political experience or history, there is a procedural part that you have to learn and I want to be a little patient and allow the President some time just to basically figure out the timelines that it takes just to get some of this done.”"
61,Chelsea Manning set for release next week,2017-05-09," (CNN) Chelsea Manning will be released from military prison next week, according to a statement from her attorneys Tuesday. A former Army intelligence analyst and transgender woman, Manning was sentenced to 35 years in prison after being convicted in 2013 of stealing 750, 000 pages of documents and videos before leaking them to WikiLeaks    one of the largest and most embarrassing leaks of classified information in US history. But   Barack Obama commuted Manning’s sentence in January, thereby providing her with an early release date.  Expressing relief about the impending release on Twitter Tuesday, Manning said: ”Freedom was only a dream, and hard to imagine. Now it’s here! You kept me alive &lt3” Manning has been forced to serve her sentence in an   military prison despite a request to transfer to a civilian prison. ”For the first time, I can see a future for myself as Chelsea. I can imagine surviving and living as the person who I am and can finally be in the outside world,” she said in a written statement. ”I hope to take the lessons that I have learned, the love that I have been given, and the hope that I have to work toward making life better for others.” Manning’s representatives could not provide her exact release date when reached by CNN, but a statement from the White House in January said her prison sentence is set to expire on May 17. ”Chelsea has already served the longest sentence of any whistleblower in the history of this country. It has been far too long, too severe, too draconian,” Manning’s attorneys, Nancy Hollander and Vincent Ward, said in a joint statement. ”President Obama’s act of commutation was the first time the military took care of this soldier who risked so much to disclose information that served the public interest.” News of Manning’s commutation set off harsh criticism from some Republicans and intelligence officials who opposed the move in January, but Obama said she had served a ”tough sentence.”"

64,Cartel Radio Network Found near Texas Border,2017-02-20,"PIEDRAS NEGRAS, Coahuila  —   Authorities in this border city have seized two radio repeaters used by Los Zetas cartel as part of an underground communication network. [Over various days, members of the Coahuila Attorney General’s Office and Fuerza Coahuila had been carrying out an intelligence operation aimed at tracking down the illicit communication network, Coahuila’s Secretary of State Victor Zamorano revealed in a prepared statement. The network was used by members of organized crime to remain in constant communication and relay the position of law enforcement forces.   The two radio repeaters and other equipment were found by police in various houses throughout the city. Authorities did not release the exact addresses, claiming they are currently investigating the homeowners for criminal ties.  As Breitbart Texas has been reporting, the border state of Coahuila has a long history of being under the control of Los Zetas and most recently under the faction called Cartel Del Noreste. For more than a year, the CDN and other Los Zetas factions such as Vieja Escuela Zetas (CDZ) or “Grupo Bravo” have been waging a fierce war for control of lucrative drug trafficking routes in various parts of Mexico including Tamaulipas, Nuevo Leon and Coahuila. As part of their regular operations, Mexican drug cartels use radio communication networks to maintain control of their areas. As Breitbart Texas has reported, in the border city of Reynosa, the Gulf Cartel has been using a radio communication network and video surveillance systems. Editor’s Note: Breitbart Texas traveled to the Mexican States of Tamaulipas, Coahuila and Nuevo León to recruit citizen journalists willing to risk their lives and expose the cartels silencing their communities.  The writers would face certain death at the hands of the various cartels that operate in those areas including the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas if a pseudonym were not used.

65,Obama vs. Sun Tzu: The Price of Not Making a Threat Assessment,2016-06-16,"President Obama is very upset at his critics, who are taking him and his administration to task for refusing to use the term “radical Islam” to describe our enemy in the terror war. [During his speech on Tuesday, in referring to the term “radical Islam,” the president stated angrily:  What exactly would using this label accomplish? What exactly would it change? Would it make ISIL less committed to try to kill Americans? Would it bring in more allies? Is there a military strategy that is served by this? The answer is none of the above. Calling a threat by a different name does not make it go away. This is a political distraction. It is interesting to note that our enemy has quite a preoccupation with this very same “political distraction. ” Indeed, back in 2011, Muslim Brotherhood front groups approached the Obama administration and demanded to look at the training materials for the FBI and law enforcement agencies to see what words they were using. It’s curious that instead of telling the Brotherhood to go away with the explanation that labels didn’t “accomplish” or “change” anything, the administration docilely obliged. More curious still, when the Brotherhood returned and demanded that all mention of words connected to Islam, such as “jihad,” “Sharia” and “radical Islam,” be purged from the manuals, the administration again docilely obliged. So we have an intriguing situation: when people who want to protect America implore Obama to use the term “radical Islam” to describe the force waging war on us, he refuses and angrily responds that “different” names don’t make things go away. But when a totalitarian ideology that seeks to destroy our civilization (and boasts that it will do so by our own hands) tells us not to use the label “radical Islam” when we were doing that, Obama follows the orders. And so, as author Stephen Coughlin has documented in his work Catastrophic Failure, the Obama administration rooted out all references to jihad and Islam from U. S. intelligence agency manuals. And this action and attitude has affected every realm of government. That’s why in the State Department, for example, an official is not even allowed to ask an immigrant about his views on jihad or Sharia law before approving his visa application. In fact, a “counterterrorism” government guide counsels that keeping Muslims out of the country for supporting Sharia law violates the First Amendment. Such is the devious mentality behind Obama’s “defense strategy” in the terror war, which demands that American officials and investigators are to consider only violent or criminal conduct when trying to keep America safe. Radical ideology is to be ignored, particularly if it has the veneer of “religious expression. ” As a result, when the Muslim Orlando mass murderer, Omar Mateen, verbalized his support for killing unbelievers for the sake of Allah and Islam, it was to be ignored, and the FBI did ignore it. That’s why they let him slide. The Bureau didn’t want to break the administration’s rules and let the potential hazard to innocent American lives get in the way of fighting racism and Islamophobia. And so we come to understand better why, when the Russians had warned the FBI about Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and the FBI looked into the brothers, Bureau investigators found nothing of concern. It is a bit difficult to find things of concern, you see, when speaking to jihadists entails never mentioning jihad. And so Tamerlan and Dzhokhar went on to set off their bombs at the Boston Marathon Massacre, killing 3 people (including    Martin Richard) and injuring an estimated 264 on April 15, 2013. And they made it very clear that they did it for the sake of Islam and Allah. But labels don’t matter. Labels did matter, though, to Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik on December 2, 2015, when they opened fire on Farook’s municipal government workmates at a Christmas party in San Bernardino, California, leaving 14 people dead and 21 wounded. Malik and Farook were inspired by the same ideas that the Tsarnaevs were inspired by. Indeed, just before the attack, Malik had been using her social media to announce her love of jihad and to pledge her undying devotion to Islamic State leader Abu Bakr  . She was linked to a jihadist mosque in Pakistan. Farook, meanwhile, had made contact with several Muslim terrorist organizations. But the Americans who were slaughtered by Malik and Farook, in the administration’s view, were clearly a small price to pay for the necessary pursuit of a utopian   world. That’s why Malik’s social media proclamations were never discovered before the San Bernardino massacre  —   because immigration officials were forbidden to review social media as part of their screening process. The Obama administration, through the highest levels of the Department of Homeland Security, explicitly banned examination of the social media of immigration applicants. John Cohen, a former acting   at DHS for intelligence and analysis, explained that this rule was in place because of the fear of a “civil liberties” backlash and “bad public relations” for the Obama administration. Even more intriguing was how the administration had actually shut down a project that would have most likely led authorities to Farook and Malik and prevented the attack in the first place. Investigator Phil Haney, a former Department of Homeland Security agent, has revealed that the government had quashed a surveillance program that he had created to identify global networks that were smuggling Islamists into the United States. The database investigated groups that had ties to Farook and Malik as far back as 2012. But the State Department and the DHS Security Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties believed that Islamophobia was at play and that the “civil rights” of the Muslims being monitored were being violated, even though an overwhelming majority of them were not even American citizens. The administration officials accused Haney of profiling Muslims, removed his security clearance and shut down his program, destroying all 67 records of information that he had gathered. One of those records included an investigation into an organization with ties to the mosque in Riverside, Calif. that Farook had attended. Haney has emphasized that if his work had been allowed to continue that it very well could have prevented the San Bernardino massacre. According to Haney: Either Syed would have been put on the   list because association with that mosque,   the   visa that his wife was given may have been denied because of his association with a known organization. Haney has also stated that he was looking into Tablighi Jamaat, a Sunni Islamic group tied to the fundamentalist Deobandi movement  —   a movement that also has ties to the Pakistani school attended by Malik. More disturbingly, Haney says that the terrorist attack in Orlando also very well could have been prevented if his investigation had not been shut down. In contrast to the president’s seemingly befuddled query on what the use of the label “radical Islam” would accomplish, Sun Tzu, the Chinese general and military strategist who authored the masterpiece The Art of War, which serves as an indispensable guide on military strategy, offers a key insight on the crucial importance of identify one’s enemy. If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle. In order to even have a chance of defeating radical Islam, therefore, which has declared war on us, Sun Tzu taught us the importance of making a threat assessment. We have to label our enemy and to isolate what inspires and sanctions the enemy’s war against us. Stephen Coughlin emphasizes this urgent rule, explaining that, as Sun Tzu instructed, we must know what motivates the jihadists and always keep in mind that it is completely irrelevant whether their comprehension of their own doctrine is accurate or not, because we must know what motivates the enemy regardless of whether his motivations are based in legitimate understandings. In other words, Coughlin writes, a national security professional’s duty:   …    is not to know true Islam it is to identify and establish a functional threat doctrine, regardless of whether that doctrine accurately tracks with ‘true’ Islam or not. What matters is that we understand the enemy’s doctrines, not whether he is correct about them. Today, unfortunately, with Obama in charge, the very opposite of what Sun Tzu and Stephen Coughlin urge must happen in order to defeat an enemy is taking place. Our language is controlled and the enemy cannot be named. Actually, naming the enemy is now hazardous for anyone working in the Obama administration. Coughlin notes: “Today, FBI and Homeland Security analysts are sanctioned if they refer to the Islamic Movement by name, even if citing to threat sources that use those same Islamic terms. ” Thus, Coughlin paints the horrifying portrait for us: the enemy has established “language dominance” over us and this situation “puts groups like the Muslim Brotherhood out of reach of investigators, national security analysts, and even concerned Members of Congress. ” In other words,   groups and individuals are now above and outside of the law. Yes, using “labels” really might accomplish something after all. During his Tuesday speech, in referring to “radical Islam,” Obama pronounced vehemently: “Not once has an adviser of mine said, ‘Man, if we use that phrase, we are going to turn this whole thing around,’ not once. ” Doubtless the president’s statement is correct. His advisers surely do not want to be punished or let go. They know what their orders are  —   and what they are allowed, and not allowed, to say. It is obvious why not once has anyone with whom Obama has surrounded himself with ever said anything to him that would empower the administration to defeat America’s enemies, defend this nation and save American lives.

66,Flynn’s Downfall Sprang From ‘Eroding Level of Trust’ - The New York Times,2017-02-15,"WASHINGTON  —   Just days into his new position as President Trump’s national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn found himself in a meeting that any White House official would dread. Face to face with F. B. I. agents, he was grilled about a phone call he had had with Russia’s ambassador. What exactly Mr. Flynn said has not been disclosed, but current and former government officials said on Tuesday that investigators had come away believing that he was not entirely forthcoming. Soon after, the acting attorney general decided to notify the White House, setting in motion a chain of events that cost Mr. Flynn his job and thrust Mr. Trump’s fledgling administration into a fresh crisis. Mr. Flynn’s rise and fall followed familiar patterns in Washington, where ambitious figures secure positions of great authority only to lose them in a blizzard of contradictions, recriminations and scandal. But rarely has an official at such a high level risen and fallen in such a dizzyingly short time, in this case just 24 days after Mr. Flynn arrived in the West Wing to take his corner office. Given his short stay at the top, Mr. Flynn’s case might be quickly forgotten as an isolated episode if it did not raise other questions, particularly about what the president knew and when. Even more broadly, it underscores lingering uncertainty about the relationship between the Trump administration and Vladimir V. Putin’s Russia, a subject of great interest given American intelligence reports of Moscow’s intervention in last year’s elections in the United States. As leaders of both parties said on Tuesday that they expected the Senate to investigate and probably even summon Mr. Flynn to testify, more details emerged about a drama that played out largely in secret inside a White House riven by competing power centers. Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, revealed that Mr. Trump had known about concerns that Mr. Flynn lied for more than two weeks before demanding his resignation on Monday night. But Vice President Mike Pence was kept in the dark and did not learn that Mr. Flynn had misled him about his Russia contacts until reading news accounts late last week. Mr. Spicer described a deliberative process in which a new president took his time deciding what to do with Mr. Flynn, a retired   general who played a major role in his campaign. The issue, Mr. Spicer said, was not about legality but credibility. “The evolving and eroding level of trust as a result of this situation and a series of other questionable instances is what led the president to ask for General Flynn’s resignation,” he said. But other aides privately said that Mr. Trump, while annoyed at Mr. Flynn, might not have pushed him out had the situation not attracted such attention from the news media. Instead, according to three people close to Mr. Trump, the president made the decision to cast aside Mr. Flynn in a flash, the catalyst being a news alert of a coming article about the matter. “Yeah, it’s time,” Mr. Trump told one of his advisers. Until around that point, Mr. Flynn seemed to think he was going to keep his job. He told The Daily Caller, a conservative news site, on Monday that he had not violated the law. “If I did, believe me, the F. B. I. would be down my throat, my clearances would be pulled,” he said. “There were no lines crossed. ” But by that evening, he was writing a resignation letter, admitting no deception, only that he had “inadvertently” passed along “incomplete information. ” The issue traced back to a call last December between Mr. Flynn, then on tap to become Mr. Trump’s national security adviser, and Sergey I. Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to the United States. President Barack Obama was imposing new sanctions on Russia and expelling 35 diplomats after the election meddling. The day after the sanctions were announced, Mr. Putin said Russia would not retaliate in kind, as has been the custom in the long, tortured history of   relations, instead waiting for a new administration that he assumed would be friendlier. Inside the Obama administration, officials were stunned. Mr. Trump publicly welcomed the decision. “Great move on delay (by V. Putin),” he wrote on Twitter. “I always knew he was very smart!” Around the same time, Obama advisers heard separately from the F. B. I. about Mr. Flynn’s conversation with Mr. Kislyak, whose calls were routinely monitored by American intelligence agencies that track Russian diplomats. The Obama advisers grew suspicious that perhaps there had been a secret deal between the incoming team and Moscow, which could violate the rarely enforced,    Logan Act barring private citizens from negotiating with foreign powers in disputes with the United States. The Obama officials asked the F. B. I. if a quid pro quo had been discussed on the call, and the answer came back no, according to one of the officials, who like others asked not to be named discussing delicate communications. The topic of sanctions came up, they were told, but there was no deal. On Jan. 12, David Ignatius, a columnist for The Washington Post, reported that Mr. Flynn had called Mr. Kislyak, setting off news media interest in what was said. Mr. Spicer, then the spokesman for Mr. Trump’s transition team, went to Mr. Flynn, who he said told him that sanctions had not come up during the call. Briefing reporters the next day, Mr. Spicer repeated the misinformation, saying that the conversation had “never touched on the sanctions. ” Mr. Flynn told the same thing to Mr. Pence and Reince Priebus, the incoming White House chief of staff, who were scheduled to go on the Sunday talk shows and expected that they would be asked about the matter, according to the two men. On Jan. 15, Mr. Pence went on “Face the Nation” on CBS and on “Fox News Sunday” and repeated that sanctions had not been discussed, while Mr. Priebus said much the same on “Meet the Press” on NBC. The topic came up again after Mr. Trump and his team moved into the White House. At his first full briefing on Jan. 23, Mr. Spicer said that Mr. Flynn’s conversation had touched on only four subjects, none of them sanctions. That caught the attention of the F. B. I. and the Justice Department. Sally Q. Yates, an Obama appointee held over as acting attorney general until Mr. Trump’s choice was confirmed, concluded that the disparity between what was said on the call and what Mr. Flynn had evidently told the vice president and others about it might make the new national security adviser vulnerable to blackmail. When foreign governments hold information that could prove embarrassing, it is considered a potential leverage point. Soon after the Jan. 23 briefing, James B. Comey, the F. B. I. director, sent agents to interview Mr. Flynn. If he told the agents what he said publicly for more than a week after that interview  —   that his conversations with the ambassador had been innocuous and did not involve sanctions  —   then he could face legal trouble. If the authorities concluded that he knowingly lied to the F. B. I. it could expose him to a felony charge. It was not clear whether Mr. Flynn had a lawyer for his interview or whether anyone at the White House knew the interview was happening. But they knew afterward because Ms. Yates, with the support of Mr. Comey, reached out to Donald F. McGahn II, the new White House counsel, on Jan. 26 to give him what Mr. Spicer called a “heads up” about the discrepancy. Mr. Trump was told “immediately,” Mr. Spicer said, and directed Mr. McGahn to look into the matter. After an “extensive review” that lasted several days, Mr. McGahn concluded that nothing in the conversation had violated federal law, Mr. Spicer said. But the president then set out to determine whether he could still trust Mr. Flynn. Mr. Spicer said Mr. Flynn stuck to his original account, making matters worse. “We got to a point not based on a legal issue, but based on a trust issue, with the level of trust between the president and General Flynn had eroded to the point where he felt he had to make a change,” Mr. Spicer said. “The president was very concerned that General Flynn had misled the vice president and others. ” Asked if Mr. Trump had instructed Mr. Flynn to talk about sanctions with Mr. Kislyak, Mr. Spicer said, “No, absolutely not. ” Asked if Mr. Trump knew that the issue had come up before the Justice Department told the White House, Mr. Spicer said, “No, he was not aware. ” Mr. Spicer emphasized that there was “nothing wrong” with Mr. Flynn’s talking with representatives of other countries to prepare for the new president taking office, and that, in fact, Mr. Trump wanted him to. By that point, Mr. Trump’s relationship with Mr. Flynn had grown more awkward. One person close to the president, who asked to remain anonymous to describe private discussions, said Mr. Trump had been “uncomfortable” with Mr. Flynn for weeks. Jared Kushner, the president’s    and senior adviser, had expressed concern about Mr. Flynn’s appointment even before the inauguration, according to another person briefed on the discussions. Mr. Trump’s views were coming around to the same point. “What he knew was that Flynn was too much about Flynn, versus Mattis,” the person close to the president said. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis was seen as deferential to the chain of command. “He loves Mattis because Mattis is respectful and  . ” Another key figure with growing concerns about Mr. Flynn was Stephen K. Bannon, the president’s chief strategist whom Mr. Flynn perceived as a rival for control over national security. Mr. Trump began asking Mr. Mattis about two weeks ago for suggestions of possible replacements for Mr. Flynn. The defense secretary recommended retired Vice Adm. Robert S. Harward. Mr. Bannon reached out to Mr. Harward last week, two senior officials said. The situation escalated late Thursday when word reached the White House that The Washington Post was reporting that the transcript of Mr. Flynn’s call showed that he had discussed sanctions, contrary to his assurances to Mr. Pence and others. White House officials confronted Mr. Flynn, who only then said that it was possible they had come up, but that he did not remember. “His story remained the same until that night,” Mr. Spicer said. “That’s when his response changed. ” That was also when Mr. Pence first learned that the Justice Department had proof that Mr. Flynn had not told the truth and had warned the White House two weeks earlier, according to Marc Lotter, his spokesman. “He did an inquiry based on those media accounts,” Mr. Lotter added, without elaborating. Another person who speaks frequently with him said Mr. Pence went “ballistic,” or at least what qualifies as ballistic for the coolheaded vice president. Mr. Pence, Mr. Priebus and Mr. Bannon urged Mr. Trump to fire the national security adviser, according to officials, but the president could not bring himself to do it, in part for fear of losing face. When a reporter on Air Force One heading to Florida on Friday asked him about The Post’s report, Mr. Trump said he had not read it. “I don’t know about that,” he said. “I haven’t seen it. ” As late as Monday, he was sticking by Mr. Flynn. He sent his counselor, Kellyanne Conway, to tell a television interviewer that he had “full confidence” in Mr. Flynn. And Mr. Flynn phoned a reporter for The Daily Caller on Monday to say the president had “expressed confidence” in him and urged him to “go out and talk more. ” In that interview, posted on Tuesday, Mr. Flynn said he had discussed the Russian diplomats’ expulsion with Mr. Kislyak. “It wasn’t about sanctions,” he said. “It was about the 35 guys who were thrown out. ” Mr. Flynn added: “It was basically, ‘Look, I know this happened. We’ll review everything.’ I never said anything such as, ‘We’re going to review sanctions,’ or anything like that. ” Either way, it was too late. When the matter came to overshadow the president’s   meeting with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada and word arrived of another Post article on Ms. Yates’s warning to the White House, Mr. Trump ordered an end to the situation. “He made a determination late in the day,” Mr. Spicer said, “and he executed on it. ”"
67,"As Canada Moves to Legalize Marijuana, Shop Owners Ask: Why Wait? - The New York Times",2016-08-22,"VANCOUVER, British Columbia  —   The Cannabis Culture Lounge has everything a pothead might need to feel right at home: $3 marijuana buds, bongs for rent, bags of Skittles and Doritos for sale, and black leather couches where customers can recline in   contemplation in a pungent haze. Never mind that it is all technically prohibited by Canadian law. Still, some enthusiasts have higher hopes for the business, which opened more than a decade ago as a kind of speakeasy for marijuana smoking  —   long tolerated by the city’s authorities. The lounge began selling marijuana after Justin Trudeau was elected prime minister in November. “This is what recreational marijuana legalization in Canada looks like,” said Jodie Emery, an activist and the   of the lounge and several medical marijuana dispensaries across Canada. Mr. Trudeau has promised to make recreational marijuana legal in Canada as soon as next year, bypassing the nation’s strict medical marijuana regulations. Under the latest rules for medical use, announced last week, patients must be registered, have a prescription and obtain their supplies only by mail from a   producer or by growing a limited amount privately. Impatient to test the shifting political boundaries, entrepreneurs have opened hundreds of illicit dispensaries across Canada, selling products like organic marijuana buds and potent cannabis concentrates, while local governments and the police have tended to look the other way. The marijuana boom they hope for has yet to materialize, though the Canadian government is now doing preliminary work on a measure to govern recreational use. Even so, the authorities in some cities have begun to crack down, raiding scores of the illegal dispensaries and arresting dozens of owners and workers. And a lobbying battle is raging between the new entrepreneurs and the licensed medical marijuana producers, who were the only ones allowed to grow and provide the plant under the old regulations. One side complains about being shut out by a politically connected cartel, while the other complains about unfair and damaging competition from those who are breaking the law. The collision of money, politics and policing has made recreational marijuana a major test for Mr. Trudeau. How he solves it will be watched closely in Canada and the United States, where federal law bans marijuana but state laws are inconsistent. “Canada is looking to hit a home run, rather than singles and doubles,” said Allen St. Pierre, the executive director of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, based in the United States. “What Mr. Trudeau is trying to do is something we can only dream about here. ” But it will not come quickly. A task force will take a few months to gather comments from local officials and the public before the Canadian Parliament starts to draft a measure. “It’s a long process, and we’re hard at it,” said Bill Blair, a Liberal Party lawmaker and former Toronto police chief whom Mr. Trudeau has put in charge of the marijuana effort. Mr. Blair said in an interview that the government’s top priorities were to keep marijuana away from minors and the profits out of the hands of organized crime. That may point to a system similar to the way liquor is sold in some Canadian provinces and American states: strictly through   or licensed stores. Some cities in British Columbia are unwilling to wait for Ottawa, though, and are introducing their own marijuana policies in defiance of federal law. The province has been a center of marijuana growing and culture for decades, and it borders Washington State, where recreational marijuana is legal  —   and extremely profitable. In Victoria, the provincial capital, where more than 30 dispensaries have opened in recent years, city leaders proposed new regulations in late July that would allow such businesses to operate if they abide by certain restrictions. Victoria is following Vancouver, which has begun issuing licenses to some of the 120 or so marijuana shops in the city, provided they comply with rules, like being at least 1, 000 feet away from the nearest school. Two licenses were granted in the spring, and at least 11 more are in the pipeline, officials said. Dispensaries that do not obtain a license will be shut down, according to Kerry Jang, a Vancouver city councilor. Mr. Jang dismissed complaints that the regulations and fees  —   up to 30, 000 Canadian dollars, or about $23, 000, for a license, and    fines for violations  —   were too onerous. “They got used to making money hand over fist with very little oversight,” he said. Krystian Wetulani, 32, who owns three shops, said he felt he was stuck in red tape. Only one of his shops has been approved, and he is appealing a denial for another. Fines are mounting while he seeks locations that will conform to regulations. “It’s impossible,” Mr. Wetulani said. “Landlords hear the word ‘weed’ and just say no. ” In the Downtown Eastside, a gritty Vancouver neighborhood, a crowd of people were smoking crack and shooting heroin on the sidewalk outside Farm, a dispensary with a     mission. It employs only women, many of them immigrants, former prostitutes or victims of sexual assault, and its proceeds help finance neighborhood programs like needle collection and a community garden. The city tolerates open use of illegal drugs in the neighborhood and a local   site for heroin users, but Farm still fell afoul of the distance restrictions in the new marijuana regulations, and had to win an appeal to stay open. Wang Jingzhi, 83, an immigrant who lives in the nearby Chinatown neighborhood, said she frequently bought marijuana from Farm to soothe the aches and pains of old age. “Whenever I smoke it, my whole body feels better,” she said in Chinese. Like many in the local marijuana business, Cait Hurley, 28, the dispensary’s manager, said she was worried that new government regulations would favor corporate interests and exclude women and the working class. “There’s a lot of fear this will all be taken away from us,” she said. Under Mr. Trudeau’s conservative predecessor, Stephen Harper, the government stripped patients of the right to grow their own medical marijuana in 2013, and centralized production and distribution through a few licensed companies. But in February, a federal court reinstated patients’ growing rights the new rules announced on Aug. 11 put that ruling into effect. Facing greater competition, the 34   producers are calling for everyone to be held to the same rules they must follow, said Colette Rivet, the executive director of a producers’ trade association, Cannabis Canada. “We would be shut down if we tried to sell to dispensaries,” Ms. Rivet said. Some critics of Mr. Trudeau’s legalization efforts see a conflict of interest in the close ties between political insiders shaping marijuana policy and the licensed producers. The head of the task force, A. Anne McLellan, is a former cabinet minister who advises a  law firm that represents clients in the industry, and Chuck Rifici, a founder of one of the licensed producers, was the volunteer treasurer of Mr. Trudeau’s Liberal Party until June. Mr. Rifici said he had no personal or political connection to the government’s legalization process, but he acknowledged that the licensed companies “typically pull in people who know how to navigate government. ” While lawmakers design new legalization policies,   entrepreneurs like Ivan Miliovski say they feel caught in the middle. Mr. Miliovski said his company, Vodis Pharmaceuticals, had spent years and millions of dollars seeking a license to produce medical marijuana under the existing regulations. His entire business plan is now in doubt. “We don’t know what’s going to happen,” Mr. Miliovski said. “The fear is that it won’t help all the people who have struggled and advocated and pushed to make this industry legitimate. ”"
68,Reince Priebus: FBI Is Still Investigating Clinton Foundation,2016-11-06,"WASHINGTON, D. C.  —   The Republican National Committee is blocking the mainstream media from controlling the narrative on the Hillary Clinton email  . [FBI director James Comey said in a letter Sunday that no charges would be made in the second Hillary email investigation, which focused on classified materials in emails found in the Anthony Weiner underage sexting investigation. The FBI focused on Weiner and his wife Huma Abedin despite the fact that it had authority to expand the investigation into Hillary’s other backup email records, some of which are in the possession of the FBI.  RNC chairman Reince Priebus is making it known that the FBI’s public corruption investigation of the Clinton Foundation is ongoing. “The FBI’s findings from its criminal investigation of Hillary Clinton’s secret email server were a damning and unprecedented indictment of her judgment. The FBI found evidence Clinton broke the law, that she placed highly classified national security information at risk and repeatedly lied to the American people about her reckless conduct,” Priebus said in a statement provided to Breitbart News. “None of this changes the fact that the FBI continues to investigate the Clinton Foundation for corruption involving her tenure as secretary of state. Hillary Clinton should never be president,” Priebus stated."

However, the director said that the perceived snubs for those films are not rooted in racism within AMPAS, as critics have charged. Spielberg said that the #OscarsSoWhite controversy  —   which erupted anew last month after the Academy nominated exclusively white actors in top categories for a second consecutive year  —   was rooted more in a lack of diversity among filmmakers, screenwriters and studio executives. “You have to look back a couple of years, where Lupita [Nyong’o] was recognized for 12 Years a Slave [and] 12 Years a Slave won Best Picture, you know?” Spielberg told THR. “I don’t believe that there is inherent or dormant racism because of the amount of white Academy members. ” With stars like Will Smith and Spike Lee pledging to boycott this year’s Oscars, the Academy unveiled a dramatic overhaul of its voting rules and organizational structure last month, with the aim of doubling the number of female and minority Academy voters by 2020. The rules limit voting rights to Academy members who have been “active” in filmmaking over at least a   period. In a series of open letters after the rule changes were announced, many longtime Academy members blasted the organization for what they charged was an overt effort to strip older, white members of their voting rights in order to boost the number of younger, more politically correct voters. In his interview with THR, Spielberg  —   whose film Bridge of Spies is up for Best Picture this year  —   said he was “not 100 percent” supportive of the Academy’s rule changes, which will not affect the voting for this year’s Oscars. “I’m also not 100 percent sure that taking votes away from Academy members who have paid their dues and maybe are retired now and have done great service  —   maybe they’ve not won a nomination, which would have given them immunity to the new rules, but they have served proudly and this is their industry too  —   to strip their votes? I’m not 100 percent behind that,” he said. Spielberg was quick to add that he thinks it is “very, very important” that the Academy has begun to open up its membership to more diverse filmmakers “in a proactive way. ” “But it’s not just the Academy, and I think we have to stop pointing fingers and blaming the Academy,” he told THR. “It’s people that hire, it’s people at the main gate of studios and independents. It’s the stories that are being told. It’s who’s writing diversity  —   it starts on the page. And we all have to be more proactive in getting out there and just seeking talent. ” When asked whether he takes the diversity of cast and crew members into account when staffing his own projects, Spielberg said his films have often included actors and crew members from diverse backgrounds even without consciously considering the issue. “Look, I have two black children, you know? I’ve been colorblind my entire life,” he said. “When you just look at the films I’ve made, and look at the people who’ve worked on those films  —   look at  the diversity within the crew, within the cast  —   I’ve always [had it]. ” In addition to Best Picture, Spielberg’s Bridge of Spies is up for five additional Oscars at this year’s ceremony, including Best Supporting Actor for Mark Rylance and Best Original Screenplay for Matt Charman and Joel and Ethan Coen. Spielberg has been nominated for Best Director seven times over his   career, winning twice for 1993’s Schindler’s List and 1998’s Saving Private Ryan. He was also awarded the Irving Thalberg honorary Oscar in 1987. The 88th Academy Awards air Sunday, February 28 on ABC."
70,Muslim Prisoner Carved ISIS Motto Into Army Veteran Cellmate’s Forehead,2016-04-10,"An Australian state has ordered a review of how radicalized prisoners are managed after a teenage inmate reportedly carved an Islamic State motto on his army veteran cellmate’s forehead, officials said Sunday. [The general manager of the Kempsey prison, 420 kilometers (260 miles) north of Sydney, had been suspended pending an investigation into the attack Thursday on the    former soldier and how he came to share a cell with an Islamic radical, Corrective Services Commissioner Peter Severin said.  Severin did not detail the allegations against the    cellmate. But newspapers reported on Sunday that he had used a sharp object to carve on the soldier’s head “e 4 e”  —  short for “eye for an eye,” a phrase from Muslim, Christian and Jewish texts that features in Islamic State propaganda. The teen also reportedly poured boiling water on his cellmate. Prison guards’ union boss Steve McMahon told Australian Broadcasting Corp. the former soldier had been “severely beaten. ” Severin said the veteran of the U. N. peacekeeping mission in East Timor “won’t have any lasting injuries. ” The veteran remained in hospital on Sunday. “I’m appalled about the fact that these two were allowed to share a cell,” Severin told reporters. “At face value, he shouldn’t have been sharing a cell with anybody,” Severin added, referring to the teen. The New South Wales state government announced on Sunday an independent investigation into the management of radicalized prisoners in the state prison system, the largest in Australia. The    had not been accused of violent extremism or terrorism offenses in the past, but had identified himself as a radical, Severin said. The teen had since been shifted to solitary confinement at the state’s highest security prison in Goulburn. Police said he had been charged with causing grievous bodily harm and with choking the former soldier until he was unconscious. Each charge carries a potential maximum of 10 years in prison. He is will appear in a Kempsey court on May 23."

72,"Kidnapped Border Patrol Agent Was Hacked with Machete, Suspects Caught",2017-06-19,"Suspects in the kidnapping and attack of a U. S. Border Patrol agent have been captured and an official statement from authorities reveals that the agent was hacked with a machete. Breitbart Texas first reported on the issue and first reported the identity of one of the suspects. In this case, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) first tried to keep the matter from the public and then downplayed aspects of the attack. [The first report on the June 9, 2017, kidnapping and attack, “Border Patrol Agent Found injured on Side of Roadway after Attack,” revealed that the issue had occurred and that CBP had not prioritized alerting the public or other Border Patrol agents.  The second report, “Border Patrol Agent was Kidnapped, FBI Leads Investigation,” relied on Breitbart Texas sources who had provided the actual BOLO (Be On Lookout) that was sent to law enforcement officers and agents on the matter. The third report, “FBI’s Suspect in Kidnapping of Border Agent is   Deported 3 Times Prior,” revealed all of the details of the BOLO, named the suspect, and source claims that the listed suspect had been deported three times prior to the attack. The recently released official statement directly confirms most of the information Breitbart sources provided. Other aspects, such as the immigration status of one of the suspects, is left unconfirmed by authorities though implied in the fact that one of the suspects’ residences is mentioned and the alleged illegal immigrant’s place of residence is omitted. The official statement from the Doña Ana County Sheriff’s Department is provided in full below: TWO MEN SUSPECTED IN ATTACK OF   AGENT IN CUSTODY,             Two men accused in the brutal attack of an   U. S. Border Patrol agent on June 9 are in custody.             On Tuesday, FBI agents in the El Paso Sector, with the assistance of Doña Ana County Sheriff’s detectives, arrested    Sergio Ivan   on an outstanding warrant of aggravated battery (great bodily harm) and aggravated assault. He is currently in custody at the El Paso County Detention Center awaiting extradition to Doña Ana County. Thursday,    Fernando Puga of Las Cruces was taken into custody by Doña Ana County Sheriff’s detectives with the assistance of FBI agents. Puga is charged with aggravated battery with a deadly weapon, aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, and attempted murder.  He is currently being held at the Doña Ana County Detention Center on a $1 million cash bond.             According to court documents filed by sheriff’s detectives,   and Puga confronted an   U. S. Border Patrol agent on Friday, June 9, as the agent was reportedly helping his mother at her tamale stand near the intersection of Stan Roberts and McCombs in northeast El Paso.             The agent reportedly left in his vehicle with   and Puga.             At approximately 11:40 p. m. that same night, a sheriff’s deputy was dispatched to Paradise Lane, just off Shalem Colony Trail west of Las Cruces. Upon his arrival, the deputy reported finding a    male subject who appeared to be suffering from multiple lacerations to his head and arms.             The male subject was later identified as the   agent who reportedly left with   and Puga from northeast El Paso. The victim said the two men were armed with a gun and a machete. Detectives say the victim was struck repeatedly with the machete.             The gun was later discovered to be a pellet gun.             Sheriff’s detectives began to piece together details of the attack with an earlier call for service, one that happened just before 9 p. m. on the same night in the 100 block of Amparo Road in Chaparral.     Deputies responded to that location on what was initially believed to be an unrelated domestic dispute. When they arrived, it was learned that   had been at the house, demanding to see his  . The woman’s sister told deputies   threatened her with what appeared to be a handgun. The sister described the vehicle   was in as an   red Nissan  —   the same vehicle that sheriff’s deputies located on the side of McCombs Road, just south of the New   state line. The vehicle matched the description provided by the victim on Amparo Road. Physical descriptions of the two suspects also matched between the victim on Amparo Road, the agent and his mother. The victim remains in critical condition at UMC. The incident is still an open investigation, in cooperation with the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security, the U. S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Texas, and the Third Judicial District Attorney’s Office. Brandon Darby is managing director and    of Breitbart Texas.

73,"EXCLUSIVE: In Trump’s NSC, Women Run the Show",2017-03-31,"As women all over the world celebrated Women’s History Month this March, little attention focused on the number of women who form the backbone of President Trump’s National Security Council. [His two deputy national security advisers  —   K. T. McFarland (pictured above) and Dina Powell, and the person in charge of writing the national security strategy  —   Nadia Schadlow  —   are women.  It’s likely the first time that women have held those positions simultaneously  —   no insignificant fact in a field that’s still  . Together, McFarland, Powell and Schadlow bring different strengths to the table. McFarland is an experienced national security hand, starting at the NSC in 1970, as an    college freshman. “At that time, there were maybe two women who were research assistants, but to be a professional expert on the national security council as a woman, in that era, at the very beginning of the baby boom, that just wasn’t going to be an option for women,” she said. “It wasn’t that we were discriminated against, it just wasn’t thought of. ” It was a momentous time  —   Richard Nixon was president, Henry Kissinger was national security adviser. The issues were the Vietnam War, Paris Peace Accords, opening to China, arms control with the Soviet Union, Middle East shuttle diplomacy. McFarland started at the NSC as the nightshift secretary and left in 1976 as a research assistant. She later returned to government when Ronald Reagan became president, and was one of the highest ranking women at the Defense Department. Her experience served her well for her first challenge on the job: Building an NSC from scratch, particularly since her   Retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, had never worked in the White House before. McFarland said she got the call from Trump on Thanksgiving night. Her first call was to her mentor, Kissinger. She then brought him and subsequent cabinet officials in to discuss their experiences. “Since President Trump did not come into office having a long experience in foreign policy and national security, had never been in government before, had never been in office before, I thought it made a lot of sense for us to start at the beginning and look   …     at former national security advisers,” she said. In the meantime, they were talking to Trump every day  —   he was already meeting and taking calls from foreign leaders. “It was a heady time, it was an exhausting time,” McFarland recalls. On January 20, she came into her new office. Her new desk was about 20 feet from where her first desk was, 47 years ago. She placed a call to Kissinger, so the dispatcher could say, “Henry Kissinger, the White House is calling. ” “He was so moved and so touched,” she said. McFarland said the first thing Trump asked her to do is look at North Korea. She convened the deputies at the Departments of State, Defense, and Treasury, the Joint Chiefs, and from the intelligence community, and instructed them to come back in a few weeks with some ideas, and to “think outside the box. ” “Don’t just think about a little bit of sanctions, a little bit of diplomacy. Open it wide, and think of any creative ideas you can and come back to us. And so they did. And what I was very impressed with was they had thought outside the box on a lot of things, and so we were able to craft some really good options for the president on how to deal with North Korea’s nuclear weapons program and that’s the process he’s in now,” she said. “We’ll do this for other issues as well  —   China, Russia, Venezuela, we’re going to look at the whole range of these issues for the president,” she added. McFarland calls terrorism “the challenge of our day. ” She said while there were kamikaze attacks during World War II, today’s terrorists are targeting civilians, not military targets, and are “happy to die as long as they can bring others with them. ” “If you look at the history of warfare, people always wanted to survive,” she said. “This is a threat we’ve never seen before. ” Fellow Deputy National Security Adviser Powell brings to the table 10 years of working on Wall Street and a “get it done” mindset. She first came into the Trump administration as an assistant to the president and senior counselor for economic initiatives. But it also made sense for Powell, an   who was born in Cairo, migrated to Texas when she was four, and worked in the former George W. Bush administration and Congress on defense issues, to expand her role to the foreign policy realm. Powell, who wants to stay out of the spotlight, is working closely with McFarland and Schadlow to help build out the national security strategy. She particularly believes in the economic empowerment of women, particularly in the Middle East. Coming from one   career field to another, she believes that talent will carry one through  —   whether it’s from a male or female. Still, she recognizes that it can be hard for women to be confident in areas where there might not be a lot of other women, and that sometimes there have to be role models to pave the way. Hers were former National Security Adviser and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, and former Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison ( ). Schadlow, in addition to experience in government as a presidential management fellow, brings to the table experience in thinking deeply about   national security planning. Her first assignment in government was at the Department of the Army, where she was first exposed to the military. She later became the Pentagon’s first desk officer for Ukraine after the fall of the Soviet Union, a job that is the equivalent of country director today. Wanting more career mobility, she left the government for the   Foundation, where she researched emerging national security threats  —   which she said was great preparation for her current role. Her role models include Marin Strmecki, senior vice president at the   Foundation, but also her mother, who migrated from Italy to give her three daughters more opportunity, and encouraged them to be independent. Supporting McFarland, Powell and Schadlow is another echelon of accomplished women, such as Victoria Coates, senior director for strategic assessments at the NSC.  Coates (pictured right) is a protégé of Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) Gov. Rick Perry ( ) and former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld. She last served as Cruz’s senior national security adviser. She has a Ph. D. in art history, and recently published a book on the history of democracy. Her role models were her mother, who is a chief compliance officer at a large firm, and Rumsfeld. She also credits McFarland with being a great friend and mentor. A typical day for them involves lots and lots of meetings. McFarland said a typical day involves getting up at 5 a. m. getting into office by 7 a. m. and receiving an intelligence briefing of major developments. Some days, she has an additional briefing on specific topics. Around 10 a. m. she usually goes in to see the president with her   Army Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, the CIA Director and other national security officials for the president’s daily briefing. “Then the rest of the day, I’m chairing meetings, I’m meeting with people on the NSC staff in the intelligence community, members of the White House staff, and then my day usually goes until seven or eight or nine o’clock at night,” she said. On one recent day, there were meetings ranging from Montenegro, Kurdish independence, to North Korea. The job is not particularly family friendly. The main obstacle? Classification issues. Much of the work can only be done in a secure environment inside the White House. That means mom has to live and work in Washington, D. C. McFarland’s five children are grown, but Powell, Schadlow and Coates all have young children who live at home outside of D. C. “You’re still not ever going to have it all  —   it’s impossible,” said Schadlow, who has three children. “I wished many times that I was a little more engaged with what my kids were learning in school, and I had the time to do a deep dive and just be part of that intellectual life that they’re experiencing, and in some ways I can’t do it    especially now,” she said. She said while there are more services for working mothers these days, it’s still a challenge. “Of course there are tradeoffs. My house is always a wreck,” she laughs. “It’s real. It’s a constant balance. ” Coates, who has a    daughter and    son, says it makes the time spent together more special. “I went to spring training with my son. We had 36 hours together  …     but they were 36 really good hours,” she said. Schadlow said as difficult as it is to be away from family, it can also be a luxury just to focus on work. “When you’re at home as a working mom, you’re constantly multitasking all day long, managing everyone’s schedules. A lot defaults to the mom, I think, still,” she said. “And here  —   no cell phones in your office, no way to communicate really    in the office. It’s really all about your work. ” “I’m so happy to have the opportunity. It’s a luxury to jump in and focus on one thing for awhile, and knowing that everyone at home has sort of agreed to just take care the  ” she said. At the NSC, the women say they’ve found no difference in treatment due to their gender. McFarland calls Trump an “equal opportunity guy. ” “President Trump is an equal opportunity guy in the sense of, I’m in a room, and as I said, I’m in the president’s daily briefing in the morning, and sometimes there’s only one woman in the room, and sometimes the vice president’s national security adviser  —   also a woman, Col. Andrea Thompson, is there, and the president will look at us and expect us to answer the tough questions just as readily as anybody else,” she said. “In fact sometimes when the really tough questions come, I look around at my male colleagues who are afraid to say something, and I’m the first one to jump in and say, ‘Well you could think of it this way, Mr. President.’ And often the only other person who jumps right in with me is the other woman,” she said. Her advice to women in any career field? “Don’t settle. Don’t settle for second best. And don’t quit, and don’t give up. ”"

75,"In Scotland, Trump Built a Wall. Then He Sent Residents the Bill. - The New York Times",2017-04-08,"BALMEDIE, Scotland  —     Donald J. Trump has already built a wall  —   not on the border with Mexico, but on the border of his exclusive golf course in northeastern Scotland, blocking the sea view of local residents who refused to sell their homes. And then he sent them the bill. David and Moira Milne had already been threatened with legal action by Mr. Trump’s lawyers, who claimed that a corner of their garage belonged to him, when they came home from work one day to find his staff building a fence around their garden. Two rows of grown trees went up next, blocking the view. Their water and electricity lines were temporarily cut. And then a bill for about $3, 500 arrived in the mail, which, Mr. Milne said, went straight into the trash. “You watch, Mexico won’t pay either,” said Mr. Milne, a health and safety consultant and   novelist, referring to Mr. Trump’s campaign promise to build a “beautiful, impenetrable wall” along the border and force the Mexicans to pay for it. The Milnes now fly a Mexican flag from their hilltop house, a former coast guard station that overlooks the clubhouse of Trump International Golf Links, whenever Mr. Trump visits. So do Susan and John Munro, who also refused to sell and now face an almost    earthen wall built by Mr. Trump’s people on two sides of their property. Michael Forbes, a quarry worker whose home sits on the opposite side of the Trump property, added a second flag  —   “Hillary for President”  —   perhaps because Mr. Trump publicly accused him of living “like a pig” and called him a “disgrace” for not selling his “disgusting” and “slumlike” home. As many Americans are trying to figure out what kind of president they have just elected, the people of Balmedie, a small village outside the once   city of Aberdeen, say they have a pretty good idea. In the 10 years since Mr. Trump first visited, vowing to build “the world’s greatest golf course” on an environmentally protected site featuring    sand dunes, they have seen him lash out at anyone standing in his way. They say they watched him win public support for his golf course with grand promises, then watched him break them one by one. A promised $1. 25 billion investment has shrunk to what his opponents say is at most $50 million. Six thousand jobs have dwindled to 95. Two golf courses to one. An     luxury hotel never materialized, nor did 950   apartments. Instead, an existing manor house was converted into a   boutique hotel. Trump International Golf Links, which opened in 2012, lost $1. 36 million last year, according to public accounts. “If America wants to know what is coming, it should study what happened here. It’s predictive,” said Martin Ford, a local government representative. “I have just seen him do in America, on a grander scale, precisely what he did here. He suckered the people and he suckered the politicians until he got what he wanted, and then he went back on pretty much everything he promised. ” Alex Salmond, a former first minister of Scotland whose government granted Mr. Trump planning permission in 2008, overruling local officials, now concedes the point, saying, “Balmedie got 10 cents on the dollar. ” Sarah Malone, who came to Mr. Trump’s attention after being chosen as the “Face of Aberdeen” for a regional marketing campaign and is now a vice president of Trump International, disputed some of the figures publicly discussed about the project, saying that Mr. Trump invested about $125 million and that the golf course now employed 150 people. “While other golf and leisure projects were shelved due to lack of funds,” she said, “Mr. Trump continued to forge ahead with his plans and has put the region on the global tourism map, and this resort plays a vital role in the economic prosperity of northeast Scotland. ” Mr. Salmond said that Mr. Trump’s impact on business in Scotland might actually be a net negative because his xenophobic comments have appalled the Scottish establishment so much that the Royal  Ancient Golf Club of St. Andrews, known simply as the RA, is unlikely to award his other Scottish golf course, the   Trump Turnberry, another prestigious golf tournament like the Open anytime soon. “I don’t see the RA going back to Turnberry, which is a tragedy in itself,” Mr. Salmond said. “But it’s also a huge economic blow: Several hundred million pounds lost  —   or, in Trump terms, billions. ” Mr. Trump, whose mother emigrated from Scotland to New York in 1930, never showed any great interest in her place of birth. But in 2008, the same year he applied for planning permission in Balmedie, he visited the   cottage on the Isle of Lewis in Western Scotland where she grew up. After emerging from his private jet and handing out copies of his book “How to Get Rich,” he reportedly told locals how Scottish he felt. “I feel very comfortable here,” Mr. Trump said before spending less than two minutes with his cousins in his mother’s homestead, The Guardian reported at the time. Within about three hours his jet had taken off. The visit clearly did not impress Mr. Ford, then the chairman of the planning committee at Aberdeenshire Council, which refused Mr. Trump permission for his golf course on environmental grounds. The ancient dunes, the committee concluded, were a “site of special scientific interest,” or as Mr. Ford put it, “Scotland’s equivalent of the Amazonian rain forest. ” In the end, it was Mr. Salmond, a   golf fanatic whose constituency includes Balmedie, who came to Mr. Trump’s defense, granting permission to proceed in the “national economic interest. ” “Six thousand jobs across Scotland, 1, 400 local and permanent jobs in the northeast of Scotland,” Mr. Salmond said at the time. “That outweighs the environmental concerns. ” Eight years later he contends that Mr. Trump took him in: “If, knowing what I know now, I had the ability to go back, I would rewrite that page,” Mr. Salmond said in an interview. “Most developments balance economic against environmental issues. The problem, and it’s a big problem, is that Donald Trump didn’t do what he promised. ” Mr. Trump later fell out badly with Mr. Salmond (whom he now calls “mad Alex” and a “ ”) first because he refused to evict residents by eminent domain and then over his plans to install offshore wind turbines a couple of miles from Mr. Trump’s golf course. “If Scotland doesn’t stop insane policy of obsolete,   wind turbines, country will be destroyed,” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter in 2014. At a parliamentary inquiry about renewable energy in 2012, Mr. Trump warned that Scotland would get into “serious trouble” if it continued to build wind turbines. Asked what evidence he had, he said, “I am the evidence. ” He then made a formal complaint about a Green Party politician who had made fun of the statement with a still from the Monty Python film “The Life of Brian,” accusing him of blasphemy and threatening to take him to court. The wind turbines, whose foundations are expected to be laid next year, still seem to rankle Mr. Trump. In a meeting right after his election victory, Mr. Trump urged Nigel Farage, the leader of the populist U. K. Independence Party  —   which has failed to win a single seat in Scotland  —   to fight offshore wind farms in Scotland on his behalf. “To actually believe that having a conversation with Nigel Farage and his henchmen about wind energy is going to change Scottish government policy is on the outer limits of possibility,” Mr. Salmond said. As a presidential candidate who was caught on a hot microphone bragging  about sexually assaulting women, Mr. Trump found little sympathy among Scotland’s political leaders, most of whom happen to be women. Nicola Sturgeon, Mr. Salmond’s successor, has called Mr. Trump’s comments “deeply abhorrent” and stripped Mr. Trump of his membership in the Global Scot business network. Kezia Dugdale, who runs the Scottish Labour Party, commented after Mr. Trump’s election that a “misogynist” would move into the White House, while Ruth Davidson, the leader of the Scottish Conservatives, described him as a “  guts, a   fool. ” And in Aberdeen, where 10 years ago public opinion was overwhelmingly in favor of Mr. Trump and his golf course, Robert Gordon University annulled Mr. Trump’s honorary degree after his comments about barring Muslims from entering the United States.

76,"Ceasefire in Yemen after day of clashes, officials say",2015-01-19,"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) Government forces and rebels in Yemen agreed to a ceasefire Monday after heavy fighting in the capital, Sanaa, Yemen’s interior minister and a rebel official said. That news came after fighting around the presidential palace and came after Yemen’s prime minister went into hiding when attackers shot at him. Nine people were killed and 67 others injured iin the clashes, Yemen’s Health Ministry said. The Yemeni government, a U. S. ally in the battle against al Qaeda, described the fighting as a power grab by rebels known as Houthis, Shiite Muslims who have long felt marginalized in the majority Sunni country.  Turmoil between the two sides is worrisome to the West because a power vacuum in Yemen could benefit al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, a terrorist organization based in Yemen that took credit for the attack on the offices of Charlie Hebdo in Paris it also tried to blow up a plane landing in Detroit in 2009. A Houthi delegate, Ali Daghshan, told CNN that the presidential committee had agreed to a deal after hours of negotiations. Interior Minister Jalal Al Rowaishan also confirmed the ceasefire had been reached. There are conflicting accounts of the cause of the clashes. Government officials characterize it as a power grab by the Houthis. Houthis say Yemen’s military attacked people demanding that authorities lift road closures introduced as a security measure after the presidential chief of staff was abducted in Sanaa a few days ago.  A Western diplomat in Sanaa told CNN the situation was complex. ”Today’s events appear to be the next stage in Houthi plans to extend their control in Yemen. But there are many players with many agendas. So this hasn’t finished playing out,” the diplomat said. It is unclear who fired first near the presidential palace Monday. Control of the palace is seen as key to the control of the country. There were reports of government buildings, a hospital and residential buildings being hit. The presidential palace is controlled by the government and mountaintops surrounding the palace are held by rebels known as Houthis, a senior interior ministry official told CNN late Monday. Both sides will remain where they are until a deal is signed, which is expected to happen Tuesday, said the official.  The Yemeni information minister told CNN’s Christiane Amanpour that government control is ”almost nonexistent.” When asked to described the situation on the ground, Nadia   said: ”This is almost a replica of what happened in September, on the 21st of September, when the Houthis came into the city and took over everything, and then there was the peace and partnership agreement, where they pulled back a little bit and allowed a government to be created.” ”Now, since then, the Houthis have not really left the capital. They’ve been around with their arms, and what happened is that they’ve been interfering in the government’s work, but we were trying to get this country going,” the minister said. The U. N. Security Council will hold a special meeting to discuss Yemen on Tuesday. Prime minister targeted, Prime Minister Khaled Bahah was fired upon when he left a meeting with President Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi and the Houthi political group Ansarallah,   said. Bahah was unharmed and is now in hiding, she said. ”He is at his place, but currently he has been surrounded by Houthi militias around his place, and they have stationed themselves at rooftops of neighboring buildings. He is worried that the situation might escalate,” said the minister. The senior interior ministry official said the prime minister was inside the Republican palace, some 7 miles (12 kilometers) from the presidential palace. The gunfire came from a Houthi checkpoint near the meeting place, and the attempt to kill the prime minister was a breach on an earlier ceasefire,   said. But a senior Houthi official condemned the attack and denied the group had anything to do with it, blaming the attempt on an unnamed third party. Houthis said their convoy had also been fired upon after leaving the talks. Adding to the disputes, the information minister said Yemeni state TV and the   Saba news agency are now under the control of the Houthi political movement. But senior Houthi official Ali AlShami denied the movement controlled either news outlet.  There are concerns that as Yemen spirals into greater sectarian violence, al Qaeda, a predominantly Sunni group, will gain an even greater foothold there, with more recruits and a base from which to attack other targets.  ”This morning, it was so chaotic. They said that nobody knew what was going on and who was in charge, and these are situations where al Qaeda can easily infiltrate and create,”   told CNN. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula has its home in Yemen, where in recent months, it has come under pressure from Houthi rebels and government forces. But the Charlie Hebdo attack may show the group’s apparent ability to direct operations beyond Yemen’s borders. It is thought likely that one or both of the brothers behind the attack in Paris visited Yemen and received weapons training from AQAP and that one may have met with the group’s former leader.  A U. S. official said the United States was monitoring the violence Monday and had sufficient military power nearby to evacuate its embassy ”on short notice” if needed. Power struggle    said gunmen linked to the Houthi political movement attacked the presidential palace in a bid to take control of the symbol of power. Hadi, the President, was not in the building and is safe,   said, but government officials were among an unknown number of casualties. Houthi rebels claimed responsibility Saturday for the abduction of presidential Chief of Staff Ahmed bin Mubarak.   said Monday’s dispute began when the government tried to implement a security plan as it feared more abductions of key staff. But a top Houthi official said Houthis tried to mediate with the army and asked for roads to be opened for citizens, which led to their people getting attacked. He said they then had to defend themselves. Hadi appointed bin Mubarak as premier in October, but the rebels rejected the nomination. Osama Sari, senior media adviser to the Houthi movement in Yemen, said the Houthis had detained bin Mubarak as a message to the President. It was because the President wanted to introduce a new constitution without the approval of the Houthis, Sari said. The abduction came amid increased tensions in the Arabian Peninsula country after the rise of Shiite Houthi rebels. Houthis swept into the capital last year, sparking battles that left more than 300 dead in a month. In September, Houthis signed a ceasefire deal with the government. Since then, its members have installed themselves in key positions in the government and financial institutions. Hadi was elected President in February 2012. He was the only candidate on the ballot."
77,Report: Stopping Only Nine Percent of Illegal Alien Border Crossers Would Pay for Trump’s Border Wall - Breitbart,2017-02-16,"If President Donald Trump’s promised border wall stops only a small fraction of illegal aliens from coming into the U. S. it would save the U. S. billions and easily cover the cost of the wall, a report released Thursday finds. [The   Center for Immigration Studies (CIS) using the estimated education level of illegal alien border crossers and immigrant education estimates from National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NAS) found that each illegal alien entering the U. S. racks up at least $74, 722 in lifetime costs, funded by American taxpayers.  “[I]f a border wall stopped a small fraction of the illegal immigrants who are expected to come in the next decade, the fiscal savings from having fewer illegal immigrants in the country would be sufficient to cover the costs of the wall,” writes CIS Director of Research Steven Camarota.  Even a minimally effective border wall that stopped less than ten percent of illegal crossings would save the U. S. billions. “If a border wall stopped between 160, 000 and 200, 000 illegal crossers —  nine to 12 percent of those expected to successfully cross in the next decade —  the scaled savings would equal the $12 to $15 billion cost of the wall,” Camarota writes. Approximately 170, 000 illegal aliens crossed into the U. S. without going through a port of entry in 2015, according to a study commissioned by the Department of Homeland Security. “[T]here may be 1. 7 million successful crossings in the next decade. If a wall stopped just 9 to 12 percent of these crossings it would pay for itself,” the CIS report states. “[T]here may be 1. 7 million successful crossings in the next decade. If a wall stopped just 9 to 12 percent of these crossings it would pay for itself,” the CIS report states. “If a wall stopped half of those expected to successfully enter illegally without going through a port of entry at the southern border over the next 10 years, it would save taxpayers nearly $64 billion —  several times the wall’s cost,” the report adds. And that’s excluding the cost of children produced by illegal immigrants. The federal government imposes a massive, unfunded mandate on school districts around the country by forcing American parents to divert funding from their own children to educate roughly 3. 62 million foreign students, many of whom are extremely   students and do not speak English. The Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) found it costs taxpayers $59. 8 billion per year to educate roughly 3. 62 million   students, children with one or two legal migrant parents, and refugees. Approximately one in ten students enrolled in public schools is designated as Limited English Proficiency (LEP) and their academic performance has been described as “abominable”: The number of eighth to twelfth grade LEP students performing Advanced work rounds to zero percent, for example. The CIS report notes that the estimates do not include illegal aliens who overstay their visas, and state and local governments bear a significant portion of illegal immigration’s costs."
78,"The bleak, depressing reality for young Arabs",2016-12-30," (CNN) Who remembers Mohamed Bouazizi? The answer, maybe, is not many of us. Perhaps we can be forgiven. So much has happened in the past six years, so much has changed. But if you happen to be a young Arab as Bouazizi was, living in the Middle East, not all of that change has been for good. Mohamed Bouazizi was the Tunisian street vendor who set himself on fire after an argument with a policeman late in 2010. He was crushed in the outfall of the 2008 economic crash. His death spread flames across the Middle East in what was to become known as the Arab Spring. Related: The man who set off revolutions, A bold and troubling UN report on Human Development in the Arab world warns the kindling that fueled the Arab Spring is drier than ever. To be a young Arab in the Middle East today is to be more disadvantaged and more vulnerable to violence than any other time in recent history. Between 2000 and 2003, there were four conflicts in the Middle East, according to the report. That number has grown to 11 between 2010 and 2015, and by the end of the decade, the report concludes, three out of four countries in the region could be ”vulnerable to conflict.”  Arabs are exposed to violence and upheaval in a way that no other large   group is. Though the Arab region contains just 5% of the world’s population, it has 17% of the global conflicts, 45% of all terrorist attacks and 57. 5% of the worldwide total of displaced people. The statistics on violence become even more worrying when the economic woes and an   population are put in the picture. At least 30% of Arabs are aged 15 to 29 years old    that’s 105 million people. Sixty percent of the population is under 30. While the Human Development Index (HDI) in the three decades prior to Bouazizi’s   showed improvements in education and health care, the economy fell behind, triggering an overall downturn. Experts use the HDI to measure ”human ” a function of long healthy lives, being well educated and having a decent standard of living. For young Arabs in the Middle East, HDI growth in the five years after 2010 is half what it was in the previous decade and markedly below the world average. The backdrop to these numbers is gloomy. The instability and political uncertainty make it difficult to look to country leaders for direction and job creation to employ their growing populations. Unemployment in 2014 was two times the global average    almost 30% of Arab young people versus a 13. 99% average in the rest of the world. And as poor economic prospects often provide a pathway toward radicalism, that alone is deeply troubling.  And consider this    In the past few months, a boatload of migrants believed to be from Libya sank in the Mediterranean with the loss of dozens of lives. It was later found many were Egyptian youths hoping to find a better life in Europe, perhaps hoping to send money home to struggling relatives. Egypt is a case in point. A population of close to 100 million, a tanking economy, rising prices and a leadership struggling to lift the country out of the downward spiral, the youth showed they had the resilience to take on the regime in protests from  . The UN report estimates young Arabs are twice as likely as   countries’ youths to take to the streets in protest. It says that 68% of Arab youths versus 87% of young people in other   countries are likely to vote    a differential that speaks volumes about their confidence in democracy and their ability to shape it. The assessment by the UN in its   report is that across the Middle East, approximately 60 million new jobs will be needed by 2020 to even begin to meet needs, never mind expectations. The implications are clear. Unless the leaders of some of the most populous countries in the Middle East rise to the challenge and create jobs    and therefore hope    for their booming young populations, there will be more strife ahead and that trouble    unlike the early days of the Arab Spring    may not stay at home."

81,"Kidney Fund Seen Insisting on Donations, Contrary to Government Deal - The New York Times",2017-04-14,"The American Kidney Fund is one of the largest charities in the country, with an annual budget of over $250 million. Its marquee program helps pay insurance premiums for thousands of people who need dialysis, a lifesaving and expensive treatment for kidney failure. The organization has earned accolades for its efficient use of the money. Under an agreement with the federal government, the Kidney Fund must distribute the aid based on a patient’s financial need. But the charity has resisted giving aid to patients at clinics that do not donate money to the fund, an investigation by The New York Times has found. The actions have limited crucial help for needy patients at these clinics. The agreement governing the relationship between the group and the companies forbids choosing patients based on their clinic. In multiple cases, the charity pushed back on workers at clinics that had not donated money, discouraging them from signing up their patients for assistance. Until recently, the Kidney Fund’s guidelines even said clinics should not apply for patient aid if the company had not donated to the charity. “I watched many patients who were not able to get that assistance,” said Elaine Brecher, a former social worker at a small clinic in rural Arkansas. After an application for one patient was declined, she said, she did not apply for others, because a colleague believed that only clinics that donated could refer patients. Ms. Brecher now works at a clinic owned by Fresenius, one of the two largest dialysis companies along with DaVita. Together, the two companies provide nearly 80 percent of the charity’s funding. She said her current patients benefited from the Kidney Fund, whose assistance can amount to thousands of dollars in financial aid a year. “If our patients didn’t get that assistance, they would be owing great big huge bills to hospitals and doctors,” she said. The financial help is available to patients with kidney failure, known as   renal disease, many of whom are unable to work. The money covers the insurance premiums for many types of coverage, including Medicare and employer and individual private plans. The Kidney Fund’s payments are part of an unusual deal it made with the government and the dialysis industry 20 years ago. The arrangement allows the dialysis companies to avoid violating   laws. It allows dialysis clinics to donate to the Kidney Fund, treat patients whose insurance premiums are paid by the charity and then collect money from the insurers for those patients’ treatments  —   essentially guaranteeing a steady stream of paying customers for the companies. But the agreement also has a caveat: It requires that all patient applications be treated equally, regardless of whether their clinic donates. In an interview this month, LaVarne A. Burton, the Kidney Fund’s chief executive, said that the charity treated all patients equally, and that the fund had never denied anyone assistance if they qualified financially. “It is simply not true that we require any provider to contribute to the program,” she said. “Never have, and never will. ” She acknowledged, though, that the charity pushed clinics hard to donate, particularly if they applied on behalf of patients. “We believe there is a moral obligation for providers to contribute to the organization,” she said. Ms. Burton said the concerns raised by social workers like Ms. Brecher and others arose because many in the industry misunderstood how the charity worked. The charity recently updated its guidelines, she said, to provide more clarity. An examination of public documents, as well as interviews with more than a dozen social workers, employees of dialysis clinics, insurance officials and regulators, and a former executive at the charity, put the actions in a different light. Many of the clinic workers, from about a   states around the country, were called randomly, to limit any chance of coordinated talking points. For years, The Times found, the Kidney Fund’s preference for patients at the biggest clinics has been an open secret among many social workers, who said that as a result they had stopped applying for assistance entirely. The findings also add to a list of concerns about the group’s relationship with the dialysis industry. This year, for example, the fund faced questions about whether it was helping dialysis companies game the Affordable Care Act. In some cases, insurers and government officials have argued, the dialysis clinics used the charity’s assistance program to push people who were eligible for Medicaid, government health insurance for the poor, into private health coverage available under the new law. The private plans pay the clinics much more than Medicaid  —   up to four times as much, adding up to an additional $200, 000 per patient per year  —   for the same dialysis treatment. In recent months, the federal government has raised concerns about how patients are steered into private plans. UnitedHealthcare sued one company, American Renal Associates, over the practice, claiming it was harming patients by converting them to less generous coverage. American Renal, which declined to comment for this article, has denied the claims and is fighting the suit. The suit against American Renal also says the Kidney Fund directed some donations directly back to patients at American Renal. As part of an investigation by Medicare, social workers and insurers have made similar accusations against the Kidney Fund. Ms. Burton denied those accusations and attributed the recent scrutiny of the insurance assistance program to insurers that want to avoid covering the often costly medical bills of people who need dialysis. “The insurance industry has let us have it full force,” she said. Dialysis filters toxins from the blood when a patient’s kidneys no longer work. The process is lifesaving, but also onerous, often requiring that patients be tethered to a machine for hours at a time, three times a week. Patients on dialysis often cannot hold   jobs, studies have shown, and those receiving the treatment are disproportionately poor. The poorest people with kidney disease qualify for Medicaid, which covers all of their costs. But Medicare covers most of the 500, 000 or so Americans who need the treatment, regardless of their age, under a government program that has existed since the 1970s and that costs the federal government more than $30 billion a year. Even with help, people covered by Medicare are left with significant    costs. Most must pay a monthly premium of about $120, as well as a portion of their medical expenses, which can add up to several thousand dollars a year. Until the late 1990s, the dialysis companies routinely paid these expenses. But a federal law outlawed that practice, out of concern that covering a patient’s bills might dissuade that patient from switching to another clinic that might provide better care. That was when the American Kidney Fund stepped in. In 1995, the charity was relatively small, with a $5 million annual budget and contributions from the dialysis industry that accounted for less than 10 percent of its donations. The Kidney Fund and the biggest dialysis clinics presented the government with a proposal that would allow the companies to indirectly pay insurance premiums for patients. The deal, reached with the Office of Inspector General at the Department of Health and Human Services in 1997, has had a profound effect on the charity. In 2015, the Kidney Fund reported revenue of $264 million, making it one of the country’s 100 largest nonprofits. The dialysis industry has also flourished. DaVita and Fresenius in particular have grown quickly, buying smaller chains, consolidating their market share and locking in profits. The Kidney Fund says it got 78 percent of its revenue in 2015 from two companies, which insurers, state regulators and others identified as DaVita and Fresenius. “There’s a long history of recognition of the unique needs of that patient population,” said Philipp Stephanus, a senior vice president at DaVita who handles patient support and insurance issues. The Kidney Fund, DaVita and Fresenius said the federal agreement prohibited them from disclosing what percentage of applications the fund approved from those companies’ clinics, or how much the charity paid in insurance aid for patients at those clinics. But the 1997 deal tried to prevent any preferential treatment, no matter how big the companies became. Kevin McAnaney, a former government lawyer who helped draft the original agreement, said fairness to patients was at the heart of the deal. Everyone understood that “they were covering free riders who weren’t contributing anything,” said Mr. McAnaney, a lawyer in private practice who previously worked at the Office of Inspector General. But if the rules are not followed, the Office of Inspector General has the right to end the agreement, which would profoundly change the relationship of the industry and the charity. “If all the conditions are not met, the opinion is without force and effect,” said Donald White, a spokesman for the agency. In keeping with the agency’s policy, he would not confirm or deny whether the agency was investigating the group. Tracey Dickey works as a social worker for a nonprofit dialysis clinic in rural Missouri with no connection to a big dialysis company, and many of her patients struggle to pay their medical bills, she said. They are exactly the kind of people the Kidney Fund says it is there to help. In November 2014, Ms. Dickey emailed an executive at the fund. She said she had heard that only clinics that donated to it could apply for financial aid for patients. Her clinic had not donated, she said  —   but she still had a patient in need. “I need to know the facts before I tell her there isn’t premium assistance,” Ms. Dickey wrote in an email to the fund. She provided a copy of the email to The Times. An executive at the fund wrote back the same day. He was noncommittal, but attached a set of guidelines that he asked her to review. “If your company cannot make fair and equitable contributions,” the guidelines read, “we respectfully request that your organization not refer patients. ” And so she didn’t. The patient, Ms. Dickey said, continues to struggle financially. This summer, after Ms. Dickey and other social workers shared their experiences in an industry discussion group, the Kidney Fund invited them to contact the charity about their concerns. When she followed up, the charity told Ms. Dickey that she would need some computer training to enroll in the program. She has not pursued it, she said. Ms. Burton said that Ms. Dickey had apparently misunderstood the exchange with the Kidney Fund employee and that had she applied, her patient would have been approved, assuming the person qualified financially. But Ms. Brecher and several workers at other nonprofit or independent clinics told similar stories. An administrator at an independent clinic in a Midwestern city said he had helped a handful of patients maintain their coverage through the fund after they transferred to his clinic from a large chain. He declined to be identified because, he said, he did not want to anger DaVita and Fresenius, who sometimes send him patients. Each time, he said, the charity’s workers later demanded that the clinic make a donation that at a minimum covered the amount it had paid for the patient’s premium. If he did not pay, he said he had been told, the patient risked losing the financial help from the charity for his insurance. The administrator said he had refused to donate to the charity. The Kidney Fund continued to help pay for the patients’ insurance, he said, but the aggressive approach angered him. Ms. Burton said the charity never declined a patient because a clinic did not donate. But she said the Kidney Fund did not hesitate to ask clinics for donations. “We are a charitable organization,” she said. “We   for everything that we do. ” She said nearly 40 percent of the 213 dialysis companies whose clinics had successfully helped patients apply to the fund had never donated. She would not say, though, what percentage of the 80, 000 patients the fund helps annually comes from clinics that do not donate, or how many of those patients come from the biggest companies, which donate most of their revenue. Still, some social workers say the assumption at many clinics where they work is that the aid decisions are not always based on financial need. Jennifer Bruns, now a social worker at the St. John Transplant Specialty Center in Detroit, worked for years in dialysis clinics and said she had many clients who received assistance from the American Kidney Fund. She said sometimes patients would tell her that their insurance premiums  —   which the Kidney Fund had agreed to pay  —   had not been paid that month. Ms. Bruns called the fund to find out why, she said in an interview, “and they would say, ‘Well you haven’t made your contribution this month. ’”"
82,"Gates: Obama Doesn’t Have Strategy To Deal With Iran In ME, WH Micromanages Military - Breitbart",2016-01-18,"Former Defense Secretary Robert Gates stated that the US lacks “a strategy of pushback from the administration” to deal with how Iran will use money it is given under the nuclear deal “To interfere” in the Middle East” and that “micromanagement out of the White House” was a concern he had due to the fact President Obama “centralized operational activities in the White House” in addition to problems with “execution” on Monday’s “Hannity” on the Fox News Channel.  Gates said that the US was “ ” on the Iran deal. “For example, we  —   the administration said as late as April  —   last Aprilthat they had to have anywhere anytime inspections, and yet that was given up. We insisted for a long time on getting the history of the Iranian nuclear weaponization’s research program, and we didn’t get that. So, I think that there were some  —   I think it’s clear that we wanted the agreement more than the Iranians. And that’s never a good position to negotiate in. But, I think as you think about the conversations you’ve been having, the real issue, it seems to me, as the Iranians get $150 billion, is the absence of a strategy of pushback from the administration to parallel this nuclear deal. Where is the strategy on how we are going to invest money, how the weapons we are prepared to provide to our allies and friends in the region, what are we prepared to do in terms of military presence, covert action, diplomacy and so on to put back consistently against the Iranians’ use of this money to interfere elsewhere in the region?” He added, “If you want to limit nuclear weapons, that’s one thing. But also you have to show that you’re prepared to deal with their actions outside of the nuclear arena, wherever they occur. ” Gates then discussed President Obama, stating, “I have two concerns  —   had two that I’ve written about. One is that he seems to be unwilling to trust subordinates to execute his policies, and so he’s centralized operational activities in the White House. So, under previous administrations that I worked for, there might be 40 or 50 professionals on the National Security Council staff, there are now hundreds, and I once asked the national security adviser, how many people do you have working on Iraq and Afghanistan. He said 25. That was half the size of the Scowcroft NSC, half the size of George W. Bush’s, or about less than  —   a fraction of  —   I mean, it’s many times the size of the NSC under George W. bush. So, this micromanagement out of the White House was one concern. The other concern is execution, of being able to make a decision,   articulate a vision and then execute it in policy. And a perfect example is the Cairo speech that he gave early in the administration, about here’s what we were going to do in the Middle East and so on. Led to a lot of euphoria, and then nothing. There was no strategy. There was no implementation. And the result was bitterness in the Middle East, because it was just seen as hollow rhetoric. ” Gates also argued the US needs to “be much more careful about when we use military force, and then use it overwhelmingly. And we’ve really only won one war since World War II, and that was the first Gulf War. ” He further stated the US doesn’t have the technological capability to fight wars without having to put troops on the ground. Gates added, “this is why presidents have to be so careful about going to war, because it always  …    means foot soldiers. ” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett"

The visit drew a contrast with President Barack Obama, who was criticized for not cutting short his summer vacation in Martha’s Vineyard to visit the stricken region. The White House announced Friday afternoon that Obama will visit the area on Tuesday, after his vacation concludes. The Republican presidential ticket traveled down miles of roads where the receding flood waters are leaving behind ruined homes and heaps of residents’ possessions.  After Trump and Pence toured the flood damage, they went to Greenwell Springs Baptist Church, to meet with Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, and Franklin Graham, president and CEO of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association and Samaritan’s Purse, an international Christian relief organization. Trump and Pence also met volunteers and were cheered by the crowd in front of Samaritan’s Purse mobile kitchen. Perkins pointed out that Obama, in contrast to Trump, was not present. The candidates later spoke with a Florida couple, Jimmy and Olive Morgan, who told them about their experience with the flood. They told Trump they spent Jimmy’s 79th birthday on a roof. Trump and Pence then stopped at Denham Springs High School, where they surveyed the damage and met with a few people, including the school’s principal, Kelly Jones. Soon after, they traveled to nearby St. Amant and met with Ascension Parish officials in a trailer. Trump and Pence helped hand out supplies to the crowd and then Trump went into a room to thank National Guard members. While in Denham Springs, he encountered a woman who thanked him for coming. ”We’re glad you’re not playing golf in Martha’s Vineyard. That’s all we can say,” the woman shouted to Trump. The real estate mogul responded, ”Somebody is. Somebody is that shouldn’t be.” Clinton calls Edwards, The mammoth flooding in the area    6. 9 trillion gallons of rain pummeled Louisiana between August 8 and 14    damaged more than 40, 000 homes and killed at least 13 people. More than 70, 000 people had registered for individual assistance since the federal disaster was declared, and more than 9, 000 had filed flood insurance claims, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Full coverage of Louisiana flooding, Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards’ office released a statement before the arrival that said Trump had not reached out to inform them of his visit. ”We welcome (Trump) to (Louisiana) but not for a  . Instead we hope he’ll consider volunteering or making a sizeable donation to the LA Flood Relief Fund to help the victims of this storm.” Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton called Edwards to get a briefing on the damage, and posted shortly afterward on Facebook about their call. ”My heart breaks for Louisiana, and right now, the relief effort can’t afford any distractions. The very best way this team can help is to make sure Louisianans have the resources they need,” she wrote in the post. ”These are our friends, our family members, our community     and they’re counting on us to reach out with open arms right now.” Obama criticized, Earlier in the week, Obama had been called on by Republicans and some in Louisiana to cut short his vacation in Martha’s Vineyard to visit Baton Rouge. ”A disaster this big begs for the personal presence of the President at ground zero,” read an editorial published in the Baton   Advocate on Thursday calling on Obama to cut short his Martha’s Vineyard vacation. ”In coming here, the President can decisively demonstrate that Louisiana’s recovery is a priority for his administration    and the United States of America.” In its statement announcing the President’s visit, the White House said Obama was ”eager to get a   look at the impact of the devastating floods and hear from more officials about the response, including how the federal government can assist and tell the people of Louisiana that the American people will be with them as they rebuild their community and come back stronger than ever.”"
85,NYU Organized One of Two Orlando Jihadi’s Trips to Saudi Arabia,2016-06-17,"The Wall Street Journal has confirmed that Omar Mateen  —   the jihadi responsible for the killing of 49 people at the Orlando night club Pulse this week  —   traveled to Saudi Arabia in 2012 as part of a program run by New York University. [The Islamic Center at New York University affirmed that Mateen “and three others believed to be his family members” booked a 2012 trip to Saudi Arabia through the university, one taken by a total of about 80 people. The trip, booked through the travel agency Dar El Salam, was nominally intended for its passengers to perform umrah, a secondary pilgrimage to Mecca, of an Islamic nature but less important than the hajj. This visit can be performed at any time during the year, unlike the hajj, though many choose the holy month of Ramadan for this voyage.  NYU offers the service of organizing voyagers through the agency to any Muslim, not just those affiliated with the university, so his presence on one of these trips does not confirm a relationship to NYU. Since these visits through Dar El Salam do not have mandatory itineraries, knowing what kind of trip Mateen took  —   specifically, through NYU  —   does not narrow down his whereabouts for the eight to ten days he spent there. “People on the trip can make their own decisions about how to spend their time, though typically most people participate in the day’s itinerary,” NYU spokesman John Beckman told the Wall Street Journal. Authorities were aware that Mateen made two trips to Saudi Arabia, the 2012 trip with NYU and the 2011 trip a year before. Both were allegedly intended in order to perform umrah. Whether it is common for young Muslims to make multiple trips to perform a lesser pilgrimage is a matter of debate. Mohammed Farooq, owner of the   Hajj Umrah Group travel agency in Fort Lauderdale, told the Wall Street Journal that such a decision is “unusual but not unheard of. ” Adnan Khan, former leader of the Council of   Affairs, told Fox News two consecutive trips of this nature were suspicious. “It’s not cheap to do so and people that young usually don’t go twice,” he argued, “And especially considering he appeared not to have come from a staunchly religious background. ” Each of the trips is estimated to have cost $ $4000 per person, typically featuring luxury hotels and an itinerary full of meals at upscale restaurants, Fox News notes. Authorities are now working to find more information regarding whether he stayed in Saudi Arabia for the entirety of his trips there, and what he was doing outside the country during the one confirmed visit to the United Arab Emirates on one of the two trips. “It’s very possible for someone to take a trip to a country like Saudi Arabia and declare it as their destination when it is in actuality just a pit stop to a different country like Yemen,” Ryan Mauro, national security analyst for Clarion Project, told Fox News. Examining his activity during the trip may shed some light on whether he received terrorist training or otherwise connected with jihadist groups prior to attacking Pulse. The one visit’s ties to NYU also raise the question of whether such programs make such training more easily accessible for those looking to leave the country to network with jihadi organizations. The NYU Muslim Students Association, the student community group tied to the Islamic Center of NYU, is a chapter of the greater national Muslim Students Organization, which has been repeatedly tied to the international Islamist group the Muslim Brotherhood by U. S. courts, particularly in the terror fundraising Holy Land Foundation trial. The NYU chapter in particular was the subject of extensive monitoring by the NYPD. Khalid Latif, New York University’s Muslim chaplain, has been outspoken in condemning the violence in Orlando this weekend, posting a statement of unity on his Facebook and Twitter pages: My thoughts and prayers are with you all. #OrlandoShooting pic. twitter.   —   Khalid Latif (@KLatif) June 12, 2016,  He has also made statements in the past, however, calling for submission to the threat of Islamist violence in the case of displaying cartoons offensive to Muhammad. Latif objected to NYU in 2010 following the announcement of a display of controversial   Danish cartoons, arguing that “the potential of what might happen after they are shown is something else that should be considered and not taken lightly. ” “All over the world Muslims have been coming together over this issue and in New York they would not hesitate in doing the same thing,” he writes, without specifying what they would to object to the cartoons. He was also an outspoken critic of a House of Representatives panel hosted by Rep. Peter King in 2011, focused on the threat of radical jihadist ideology. The panel, he told iCNN, was “just going to push us further apart” because targeting jihadists “isolates [Muslims] in the broader society and prevents other groups from really being able to understand similar qualities and values we have simply because we are human. ” He specifically condemned the Tea Party movement for “expousing unamerican values. ”"

[This Chris Christie endorsement of Trump is real signal to GOP establishment that they had better begin thinking about Trump as the future,  —   Newt Gingrich (@newtgingrich) February 26, 2016,   Christie formally endorsed Trump Friday at a press conference in Texas, where he said that Democrats fear facing off against Trump in the general election. Gingrich touted Trump’s potential in an exclusive interview with Breitbart News in December before any primaries had taken place. “I think he represents a different era” in the conservative movement, Gingrich said. “The system has become so incompetent and outrageously bureaucratic. The centers of power are so, so in New York, Washington, D. C. and Los Angeles, that the whole rest of the country is in rebellion. And people are looking for somebody who can kick down the doors. ” “It’s a very deep, very real movement,” Gingrich said. Trump is leading the most recent polls in eight of twelve Super Tuesday states, while two states have dated polls conducted before Trump won his historic victory in the South Carolina primary. Trump is widely leading the Republican field. After Super Tuesday, he will focus on defeating Marco Rubio in Florida on March 15. Trump is leading Rubio there 44 to 28, according to the Quinnipiac poll."
88,Pokemon fever rages near North Korean border,2016-07-23,"Sokcho, South Korea (CNN) It looks like a beautiful   bonding moment.   In matching red   hunched over two smartphones, a father coaches his young boy in how to catch Pokemon.   You have to wonder if they even know they have walked onto the beach as they huddle together in absolute concentration. This is a scene replicated across the seaside city of Sokcho in South Korea, 35 kilometers or 20 miles away from the DMZ or demilitarized zone which splits North and South Korea.    Smartphones raised, brows furrowed, Pokemon Go zombies in a world of their own have taken over the streets of Sokcho     and the game isn’t even available in this country yet.  This is the only area in South Korea you can play the augmented reality game that has swept the world, largely thanks to a technical loophole.   This northeastern tip of South Korea lies just outside the index grids the game’s developers use to geographically block the country. A parent’s guide to Pokemon Go, Busloads  Thousands of South Koreans are making the pilgrimage here to play. Special Pokemon Go buses leave Seoul daily and the seats sell out in advance. Park   says he was fed up with watching friends from the United States post their Pokemon achievements on Facebook so when he found out he could play three and a half hours away from Seoul, he didn’t hesitate. ”It’s pretty interesting because it’s something that relates to our reality. Pokemons are appearing in our world. I think it’s awesome,” he says.     His friend Krystal Xiong traveled from her home in Beijing    China is another country where the game is not yet available. Sokcho residents appear to have embraced their newfound fame, none more so than the mayor himself, Lee   or Dr. Lee as his Pokemon alter ego is known.  Arriving at one of the busiest Pokemon spots in town for our interview, he is dressed like Professor Oak, one of the game’s characters and the gamers love it.   They’re taking photos of themselves with ”Dr. Lee” talking to him about the game    a short break before wondering off again in search of monsters. Pokemon disrupts State Department briefing, Lee has organized extra   zones and mobile charging stations around town and local businesses are offering discounts to customers who have caught the most Pokemon.  ”Our residents are very happy and thankful we can play this here because it’s the only region in South Korea,” says Mayor Lee. ”I think we are blessed.” As long as Pokemon Go is not available elsewhere in South Korea, he should feel blessed. He sees a long summer ahead of him filled with extra tourists, hotels are booked out and Sokcho is now well and truly on the map. Pokemon Korea says at this point ”nothing is decided” on when the game will officially launch here.   Some local media have suggested the fact Google Maps is restricted here due to security concerns may complicate the matter. The South Korean government denies that.   Google is requesting full map data from South Korea, a request that has to be cleared by seven ministries, including the defense and foreign ministries and the National Intelligence Service.   Under South Korean law, any map has to have certain security installations blurred or blacked out. The government says it will give Google an answer before August 25. But for now, restrictions and geographical blocking aside, one city in South Korea is enjoying its special status as the country’s holy grail for Pokemon fans.

90,GOP House votes to reject stream protection rule,2017-02-02,"Washington (CNN) The   Congress took its first steps Wednesday to roll back environmental, financial disclosure and energy regulations put in place by the Obama administration. The House passed a resolution,   that would repeal the ”Stream Protection Rule,” a measure issued recently that barred mining companies from putting any of their waste in local waterways. The Senate is expected to approve the resolution as early as Thursday and send it to the President’s desk. The House also approved another resolution on Wednesday that eliminates a rule that required oil and gas companies from disclosing payments to foreign governments for gaining access to their energy resources.  Republicans are using the Congressional Review Act to target regulations enacted in the final 60 days of the Obama administration. Since its creation, there has only been one instance when Congress was able to overturn a regulation.

91,A new golden age of Egyptian cinema?,2016-12-06," (CNN) In 1896, several exclusive venues in Alexandria and Cairo hosted some of the earliest known screenings of the world’s first movies, directed by the Lumiere Brothers.  Egypt went on to establish a dominant position as the capital of the Arab film world. The ”Hollywood on the Nile” enjoyed a sustained Golden Age in the   century, powered by the mighty Studio Misr and international stars such as Omar Sharif and Faten Hamama.  But the glory days could not last, and the industry suffered a devastating blow with the 2011 revolution. Curfews were imposed that severely reduced cinema audiences, and production slowed to a crawl.  The aftershocks continued with the overthrow of President Mohamed Morsi in 2013, and subsequent violence across the country.  But after years of instability, there are signs that the Egyptian movie powerhouse is coming back to life.  Green shoots? Earlier this year, romantic comedy ”Hepta” demonstrated that audiences are returning to cinemas, breaking the box office record for the genre with takings in excess of $3 million. Egyptian films are also earning international critical acclaim. Mohamed Diab’s ”Eshtebak” (Clash) set entirely in a police van during the revolution, earned strong reviews at the Cannes Film Festival and is being tipped for an Oscar nomination.  Filmmaker Amr Salama, who won several international awards for his groundbreaking portrayal of an AIDS patient in ”Asmaa” believes the industry is flourishing.  ”I believe there is a new wave in Egypt,” Salama told CNN. ”There is a new type of  . ..and I am very proud if I can consider myself one of the talented directors that formed the wave.” Egyptian cinema is recovering strongly, according to Sherif Mandour, producer and executive board member of the government’s Chamber of Cinema. He claims that 40 feature films were made this year, which will rise above 60 in 2017, compared with just 20 in 2011.   ”After the revolution it was not secure to go to cinemas but now people are going again, and it is becoming a fruitful business,” says Mandour.  The official adds that the government has increased funding for   from 20 million Egyptian Pounds ($1. 11million) to 50 million ($2. 77 million) per year, which will support increased production, with an emphasis on innovation.   Mandour acknowledges that rival Arab industries such as Morocco and Algeria have stolen a march on Egypt, but says it is a national priority to regain      and points to a key advantage. ”Cinema was a huge part of our soft power over history,” he says. ”It is not the same now and the competition is increasing, but Egypt has a space because we have the only language that is understood in all 22 Arab countries.” Creative compromise, A growing number of Egyptian films are gaining critical or commercial success    but rarely both.  Hala Khalil’s ”Nawara,” the story of a downtrodden maid’s experience of the revolution, scooped international prizes but mediocre returns at the box office. The director claims that studios have too much power and demand ”popcorn” movies over more serious material.  ”The big distributors and producers don’t support our films because they say audiences don’t like them,” says Khalil. ”They talk badly about movies that are not action or comedy.” ”We have a big industry but it is not for directors like me that make serious films. The producers and distributors control everything and they decide if your film succeeds or not.”  Censorship is another barrier, according to Khalil.  ”There are three taboos sex, religion and politics,” she says. ”You have to be conservative as a director, and as my films deal with social issues it is difficult with those taboos.” Directors must be creative to ”find an angle” that will allow a controversial script to pass censors, says Khalil, such as setting an interfaith relationship in the past for her next movie.  The nature of censorship is changing, according to critic Mohamed Andeel, which he believes reflects the government’s hostility to the Islamist values of opponents the Muslim Brotherhood.  ”I noticed a drop in the number of works that challenge the police or army, or talk about corruption,” he says. ”At the same time there is a rise in TV shows and movies with drug or alcohol consumption.” New frontier, Andeel believes that Egyptian cinema is seeing individual successes rather than a movement.  The current generation of   lack the unity and purpose of the 1980s New Realists, according to the critic, or the grand resources of the 1950s Golden Age. But a new movement could emerge from a surprising source. Andeel is optimistic that a generation of internet amateurs, who can bypass the censors and the studios, will reshape the landscape.  ’Encounter with death’ by Alaa Assem, ”The internet is encouraging so many people every day to become artists and create new forms of ” he says. ”Many Egyptians are doing it all the time and I’m fascinated by that.” Andeel acknowledges that the work of internet directors typically lacks polish and resources. But with growing interest in this emerging field   including a new online film festival   he expects them to mature and flourish. ”I hope as more young people start making Vines and YouTube videos they become interested in making artwork with a slightly longer life,” he says. ”I expect there will soon be a lot of   for the internet which will open completely new topics and challenge taboos.” Egypt’s next revolution may be underway.

[The      actress joined fellow actors Johnny Depp and James McAvoy on the Graham Norton Show Friday night, where she revealed that she once attended a concert at which the Republican presidential frontrunner was also present.  “I was at a concert that I heard he was attending, so I had my full security, I was like, ‘Find Donald Trump,’” Lawrence told Norton. “Because I was adamant on finding him and then making a video of me going, ‘Hey Trump, f*ck you! ’” “I wouldn’t rest until he was found,” the actress continued over the audience’s enthusiastic applause. “He knew I was looking for him. ” Meanwhile, Depp told Norton about his experience playing Trump in   comedy website Funny or Die’s Art of the Deal movie in February, and even offered up some    impressions of the GOP candidate. “Adam McKay, who I admire greatly and is one of the funniest humans alive  —   we had a meeting and we were sitting there talking and he said, ‘How would you like to do a feature film in four days? ’” Depp recalled. “I said, ‘I like that idea.’ And then he said, ‘How would you like to play Donald Trump?’ And I loved that idea.

93,Black Lives Matter Was Gaining Ground. Then a Sniper Opened Fire. - The New York Times,2017-01-17,"It felt like a watershed moment for a scattered and   civil rights movement. Inside Black Lives Matter, the national revulsion over videos of police officers shooting to death black men in Minnesota and Louisiana was undeniable proof that the group’s message of outrage and demands for justice had finally broken through. Even the white governor of Minnesota, Mark Dayton, in a pained public concession, embraced the movement’s central argument. “Would this have happened if those passengers  —   the driver and the passengers  —   were white?” he asked. “I don’t think it would’ve. ” Then, in an instant, everything changed. Black Lives Matter now faces perhaps the biggest crisis in its short history: It is both scrambling to distance itself from an   sniper in Dallas who set out to murder white police officers and trying to rebut a chorus of detractors who blame the movement for inspiring his deadly attack. “What I saw in Dallas was devastating to our work,” said Jedidiah Brown, a Chicago pastor who has emerged as an outspoken Black Lives Matter activist over the past year. The moment he learned of the attack on the police, he said, he immediately sensed that any emerging national consensus would “tear down the middle. ” “The thing I vividly remember thinking was, this is going to show exactly how divided this conversation is,” he said. For those who have harbored doubts or animosity toward Black Lives Matter  —   among them police unions and conservative leaders  —   the Dallas attacks are a cudgel that, fairly or not, they are eager to swing. In Texas, several state officials, including Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, lashed out at the group, directly linking its tone and tactics to the killings. Mr. Patrick acknowledged that the demonstration in Dallas on Thursday night had been peaceful until the gunman struck, but he accused the movement of creating the conditions for what happened. “I do blame former Black Lives Matter protests,” he said. “This has to stop,” Mr. Patrick said, adding of the police officers, “These are real people. ” State Representative Bill Zedler, a Republican, was equally blunt in his assessment of the group’s influence on the    gunman, Micah Johnson. “Clearly the rhetoric of Black Lives Matters encouraged the sniper that shot Dallas police officers,” he wrote on Twitter. But a bigger problem for Black Lives Matter, supported by many liberals, is that Mr. Johnson’s actions could jeopardize the movement’s appeal to a broader group of Americans who have gradually become more sympathetic to its cause after years of highly publicized police shootings. In the days before the Dallas massacre, Aesha Rasheed, 39, an activist in New Orleans, felt that at long last, white and black America were watching the same images with the same horror: two Louisiana police officers tackling and then shooting Alton Sterling, 37, at   range the slumped,   body of Philando Castile, 32, after a Minnesota police officer shot him through a car window, with his girlfriend and her daughter sitting inches away. “It seemed like a national consciousness was sinking in,” Ms. Rasheed said. After the massacre in Dallas, she said, “it turned on a dime. ” She now worries that the episodes involving black men may be overshadowed and overlooked. “Does this get ignored?” she asked. “Do five officers take center stage?” Black Lives Matter usually spurns central planning and management. But in a sign of alarm over the volatile situation, leaders of several organizations associated with the movement put out formal statements that repeatedly described the Dallas attacker as a lone gunman, unconnected to the group’s cause. “There are some who would use these events to stifle a movement for change and quicken the demise of a vibrant discourse on the human rights of Black Americans,” read a statement from the Black Lives Matter Network. “We should reject all of this. ” The police have said Mr. Johnson  —   a military veteran who told the authorities that he had hunted down white police officers as retribution for their abuses  —   had no direct links to any protest group. But in recounting Mr. Johnson’s final hours, Chief David O. Brown of the Dallas Police Department mentioned the movement by name. “The suspect said he was upset about Black Lives Matter,” he said. The wider world may now expect or even demand a period of reflection and restraint from the members of Black Lives Matter. But public, nonviolent confrontation, rather than private conciliation, is central to the group’s mission: shouting at police officers, for example, or staging elaborate “ ” that evoke death at the hands of law enforcement. This    style has at times rankled even the movement’s allies: A Black Lives Matter protester interrupted Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont during a Seattle campaign rally in August and seized control of his microphone, inflaming his aides and some of his supporters. “Excuse me!” Mr. Sanders cried. That combative approach is deliberate. The group is premised, activists said, on a rejection of what they see as a dominant mainstream culture that has marginalized the value of   lives for decades. Black Lives Matter was born, as a phrase and a rallying cry, after the 2013 acquittal of George Zimmerman in the Florida shooting death of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed     . By the time demonstrators took to the streets of Ferguson, Mo. a year later to protest the killing of Michael Brown, another unarmed   it was the motto and name of a decentralized collection of activists. Today, at least 37 groups operate under the movement’s name, and tens of thousands of supporters identify with its cause. In interviews on Friday, activists scoffed at calls to recalibrate their message or their strategy, or to temporarily pause protests out of respect for the dead police officers in Texas. By Friday night, protesters had returned to the streets in multiple cities, swarming the Williamsburg Bridge in New York shutting down a major highway in Atlanta and marching through downtown Phoenix, where officers used pepper spray and beanbag guns to keep the demonstrators from taking over Interstate 10. In each city, the protesters were trailed by the police, as they were in Dallas. But it was clear that the national conversation had changed. On social media, Black Lives Matter activists watched with dismay on Thursday night as a squall of outrage and mourning over the shootings of Mr. Sterling and Mr. Castile was suddenly overwhelmed by a furious outcry over the shooting of Dallas police officers and messages of rage directed at activists and protesters. The hashtag #blacklivesmatter was joined by #bluelivesmatter, a rival reference to police officers. “This   rhetoric has to stop. It’s sickening,” wrote one Twitter user using the hashtag. “We will not forget or forgive,” wrote another. Sitting in his bed after midnight with an iPhone, DeRay Mckesson, 30, a Black Lives Matter activist, watched the rapid change in tone. “It suddenly became about blame,” he said. “People wanted to link it to the protesters no matter what. ” Undeterred, several activists rebuffed the view of the carnage in Dallas as a potential setback to their cause. Ja’Mal Green, another activist, said the killings were, in their own grisly way, a powerful   call. “It’s not a setback at all,” Mr. Green said. “That’s showing the people of this country that black people are getting to a boiling point. We are tired of watching police kill our brothers and sisters. We are tired of being tired. ” He insisted that he was not encouraging violence. But he said there “comes a time when black people will snap. ” He added: “It only takes a couple to get past that boiling point. You saw that in Dallas. ” As conservative commentators like Rush Limbaugh assailed Black Lives Matter as “a terrorist group committing hate crimes,” activists like Wendi  ’Neal saw echoes of repeated attempts throughout American history, including efforts by the federal government, to discredit civil rights groups and leaders. “It’s just made up,” she said of those who held Black Lives Matter responsible in any way for the Dallas attack. “It’s not true. ” “I can’t think of any of the justice or liberation organizations that I know,” Ms.  ’Neal said, “that have an investment in shooting cops. ”"

Republican platform delegates are gathering in Cleveland Monday and Tuesday to finalize the language in the party’s platform. “Created Equal will increase the presence of these horrifying pictures of abortion leading up to the convention, July 18 through 21,” says Harrington. “Our goal is to send a strong signal to the RNC to rescue the unborn  —   beginning with a commitment to defund Planned Parenthood. ” “There’s been a lot of debate about the platform  —   whether there will be any changes,” Harrington tells Breitbart News in an interview. “Not just on the   issue, but homosexual marriage, LGBT issues, and so on. So, until it’s written, we’re obviously concerned. ” “The presumptive nominee has been unclear in some ways on his position regarding abortion, and so, we’re going to keep the pressure on,” Harrington continues. “What we want is a provision and a plank to defund Planned Parenthood and redirect the half a billion dollars that’s given to Planned Parenthood to federally accredited health services or health clinics around the country. ” While Donald Trump has said he has switched from being   to   and that he would defund Planned Parenthood if the organization continues to provide abortions, he has also praised the abortion business for helping “millions and millions” of women. He has also said he would consider changing the RNC platform to include exceptions to abortion for rape and incest. #OperationRNC wants to see the $540 million in taxpayer funding  —   currently given to Planned Parenthood  —   redirected to 13, 000 federally licensed health clinics which provide true comprehensive women’s health care. Rep. Diane Black ( ) a member of the House’s Select Investigative Panel on Infant Lives which has been investigating Planned Parenthood, explained last year, “For every one Planned Parenthood facility, there are 20 federally qualified health centers. Planned Parenthood is trying to put a message out there that if they went away, all these women wouldn’t have care. ” A report on Black’s website notes that FQHCs “provide women with the same preventative services offered by Planned Parenthood, plus the many things they do not offer: mammograms, prenatal care, treatment of diabetes, hypertension, arthritis, depression, etc. ” “In states where the state legislature has defunded Planned Parenthood,   women are still able to access the same preventative services offered by Planned Parenthood in addition to many others through these FQHCs as well as community health centers,” the report continues. “These health care providers far outnumber the number of Planned Parenthood locations, which are primarily located only in urban areas. ” Another   banner will fly over the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia bearing the message “Defend UNborn Children. ” The Democrat Party and its presumptive nominee Hillary Clinton have fully embraced abortion and Planned Parenthood in the party platform, vowing to eliminate restrictions on taxpayer funding of abortion. Clinton has said unborn babies have no constitutional rights."
96,Supreme Court Strikes Down Ban on ’Racially Disparaging’ Trademarks - Breitbart,2017-06-19,"The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit Monday, holding that a law prohibiting “disparaging” trademarks violates the First Amendment. [The unanimous Court in Matal v. Tam struck down a provision of the Lanham Act, the main law on trademarks, that barred the Patent and Trademark Office from issuing any trademark protections to marks that “may disparage   …     persons, living or dead, institutions, beliefs, or national symbols, or bring them into contempt, or disrepute. ”  This case concerned a rock band called the “The Slants,” a reference to the racial slur for Asians. When Simon Tam, the band’s   frontman, tried to register his group’s name with the trademark office, he was told he could not get a valid trademark because the name was offensive to Asians. Before the Court, Tam’s attorneys argued that his intention was to “reclaim” the term “slants” and subvert its offensive potential. The   provision, 15 USC §1052( a) has rarely had any practical effect, but has come to public notice in recent years as   advocates and public officials sought to use it to invalidate “offensive” trademarks. Most prominently, the Washington Redskins football team, who have twice had their trademark protections revoked for having a name that “disparages” American Indians. Writing for the Court, Justice Samuel Alito reasoned that the entire purpose behind the provision rendered it facially unconstitutional. “It offends a bedrock First Amendment principle: Speech may not be banned on the ground that it expresses ideas that offend,” he wrote. In contravention of this principle, the Patent and Trademark Office devised a test to determine whether a trademark was too offensive for the federal government to protect. If a “substantial composite, although not necessarily a majority, of the referenced group would find the proposed mark . . . to be disparaging in the context of contemporary attitudes,” the trademark could not be registered. This test, by disfavoring a certain subset of speech specifically on the view it expressed, constituted “viewpoint discrimination,” a fundamental limit on government’s power to regulate private speech. The provision was not saved by the government’s arguments that trademark protection was a matter of “government speech” or was a “subsidy” over which the first Amendment did not apply in its broadest sense. “If private speech could be passed off as government speech by simply affixing a government seal of approval, government could silence or muffle the expression of disfavored viewpoints,” the opinion reads: Holding that the registration of a   converts the mark into government speech would constitute a huge and dangerous extension of the   doctrine, for other systems of government registration (such as copyright) could easily be characterized in the same way. A concurring opinion by Justice Anthony Kennedy and joined by the Court’s more liberal justices, called the policy “the essence of viewpoint discrimination,” and determined there was no need to even consider the government speech and subsidy arguments. The same law was held unconstitutional on the same grounds by an en banc panel of the Federal Circuit in 2015. The government, then represented by   Solicitor General Donald Verrilli, petitioned to the Supreme Court in a last attempt to save the law. Monday’s ruling by the nations highest court cements the end of the seldom enforced provision."

98,Crackdown: Turkey Blocks all Access to Wikipedia,2017-04-30,"ISTANBUL (AP)  —   In a move that social media users called censorship, a Turkish court on Saturday blocked access to Wikipedia, the free online encyclopedia, enforcing an earlier restriction by Turkey’s telecommunications watchdog. [The Information and Communication Technologies Authority (BTK) said an Ankara court ordered Saturday that a “protection measure” related to suspected internet crimes be applied to Wikipedia. Such measures are used to block access to pages or entire websites to protect “national security and public order. ”  In response, Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales tweeted his support for those who labeled the decision censorship: “Access to information is a fundamental human right. Turkish people I will always stand with you to fight for this right. ” Turkey Blocks, an internet censorship monitor, said users in Turkey have been unable to access all language editions of Wikipedia since 8 a. m. Saturday. “The loss of availability is consistent with internet filters used to censor content in the country,” the monitor said. The site had initially been blocked by BTK under a provisional administration measure. The exact reason for the ban remains unclear. But Turkey’s official news agency, quoting the Ministry of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communications, said Saturday the site was blocked for “becoming an information source acting with groups conducting a smear campaign against Turkey in the international arena. ” The   Anadolu Agency said officials had warned Wikipedia to remove content likening Turkey to terror groups but the site “persistently” did not. Turkey had demanded that Wikipedia open an office in the country, act in line with international law and abide by court decisions and not be part of “blackout operation against Turkey,” according to the agency. Anadolu said if these demands are met and the content removed, the site would be reopened. Opposition lawmakers also criticized the court order. Republican People’s Party parliamentarians Eren Erdem tweeted the ban puts “Turkey in line with North Korea” while Baris Yarkadas called it “censorship and a violation of the right to access information. ” Turkey’s status is listed as “not free” on the 2016 Freedom on the Net index by independent rights watchdog Freedom House. It says over 111, 000 websites were blocked as of May last year. Wikipedia, a collaborative online reference work, says it is ranked among the 10 most popular websites."
99,Six New England Patriots Say They Will Skip a White House Visit - The New York Times,2017-02-13,"At least six members of the Super   New England Patriots have said they will not visit the White House for the traditional meeting that championship teams have with the president. Running back LeGarrette Blount, defensive end Chris Long and defensive tackle Alan Branch on Thursday became the latest to announce that they would skip the visit. Long posted on Twitter that he “planned on skipping” in response to a column in The Daily News that urged him to skip. Blount revealed his decision on Fox Sports in a radio interview on “The Rich Eisen Show” later in the afternoon. “I just don’t feel welcome in that house,” Blount said. “I’m going to just leave it at that. ” Branch told Sirius XM Radio that he planned to spend time with family. A day earlier, the Pro Bowl linebacker Dont’a Hightower bowed out when he told ESPN, “Been there, done that,” having visited with a championship Alabama team. Tight end Martellus Bennett told reporters after the Super Bowl that he would not go: “It is what it is,” he said. “People know how I feel about it. Just follow me on Twitter. ” The outspoken Bennett had joked that he might move to outer space after Donald J. Trump was elected. The Pro Bowl safety Devin McCourty, a team captain,  told Time magazine: “Basic reason for me is I don’t feel accepted in the White House. With the president having so many strong opinions and prejudices, I believe certain people might feel accepted there while others won’t. ” Bennett and McCourty were in the news for their activism last fall, when they raised their fists in protest during the national anthem for one game. At the time, athletes in various sports were protesting racial oppression in the country. The number of Patriots absences may well increase. Running back James White said he had not made up his mind whether to go. “I’ll wait till the time comes and decide then,” he said. No date has been scheduled for this year’s ceremony honoring the Patriots. The ceremony for last year’s champions, the Broncos, took place in June. Perhaps no other team has as close an association with Trump as the Patriots. Just before the election, Trump claimed that he had the support of Patriots quarterback Tom Brady and Coach Bill Belichick. Brady, who displayed a “Make America Great Again” cap in his locker during the campaign, never explicitly endorsed Trump, but he spoke favorably of him and they have socialized. Trump also cited a supportive letter he had received from Belichick, and several news media accounts confirmed the letter was authentic. The team’s owner, Robert K. Kraft, has said he has considered Trump a longtime friend. Brady did not attend his team’s visit with former President Barack Obama at the White House, in 2015, citing family issues. But some athletes who have skipped the trip over the years have explicitly given politics as a reason. Bruins goalie Tim Thomas declined to visit the Obama White House with his teammates in January 2012, saying in a statement: “I believe the federal government has grown out of control, threatening the rights, liberties and property of the people. “Because I believe this, today I exercised my right as a free citizen, and did not visit the White House. ” Baltimore Ravens center Matt Birk cited his opposition to abortion as the reason for skipping a 2013 visit. A number of other athletes have skipped the ceremony while citing scheduling conflicts or family commitments. Presidents for years have invited sports figures to the White House, but the tradition of honoring championships teams there solidified under Ronald Reagan. Major professional champions and many college champions stop by for a presentation and a photo opportunity. Six Patriots, so far, won’t make the trip this year."
100,NYT Publisher Sends Personal Message to Subscribers Who Canceled Over Bret Stephens Column - Breitbart,2017-05-13,"The publisher of the New York Times is personally reaching out to former subscribers who canceled their subscriptions over the paper’s decision to hire conservative columnist Bret Stephens. [Publisher Arthur O. Sulzberger Jr. sent an email Friday afternoon to former subscribers who specifically mentioned Stephens as the reason they canceled their subscriptions but still opted in to receive messages from the Times, Politico reported.  “Our customer care team shared with me that your reason for unsubscribing from the New York Times included our decision to hire Bret Stephens as an Opinion columnist. I wanted to provide a bit more context,” Sulzberger began the letter. Less than six percent of readers who cancelled their subscriptions to the Times listed Stephens as a reason for dropping their subscriptions, according to a Times spokesman. Stephens, a former Wall Street Journal columnist and critic of President Trump, got slammed by Times readers after he penned his first column questioning the validity of the science behind climate change. The column led to complaints from various progressives on Twitter, a Change. org petition demanding the paper rescind Stephens’ job offer, canceled subscriptions, and a public editor column devoted to responding to readers’ complaints about Stephens. Sulzberger said in the letter that it is important that readers recognize the difference between news and opinion while noting that NYT Executive Editor Dean Baquet “has sharply expanded the team of reporters and editors who cover climate change. ” The publisher mentioned several recent Times articles on climate change, such as one article that suggested climate change caused rising waters in China, and then encouraged readers to “sign up for a free newsletter” from the “climate desk” for news about the subject. “The Times’s Opinion pages remain an independent and unblinking forum for debate from a wide range of viewpoints among   informed writers and readers. I don’t think, in these polarizing and partisan times, there’s anything quite like it in American journalism,” Sulzberger wrote. He added that with so many people “talking past each other about how best to address climate change,” he hoped that exposing people to different viewpoints on the subject will encourage people to work together to come up with bipartisan solutions. Sulzberger, however, still maintains that the paper will only publish certain points of view over others. “This does not mean that the Times will publish any commentary. Some points of view are not welcome, including those promoting prejudice or denying basic truths about our world. But it does mean that, in the coming years, we aim to further enrich the quality of our debate with other honest and intelligent voices, including some currently underrepresented in our pages,” he wrote."
101,Ted Cruz: Establishment Has Abandoned Marco Rubio for Donald Trump - Breitbart,2016-01-20,"Ted Cruz has a theory as to why everyone is warming up to Donald Trump: Trump will make deals in Washington D. C. instead of fighting for conservatism. [Speaking to reporters after a campaign rally, Cruz said that the establishment was no longer looking to Marco Rubio as their champion.  “We’re seeing something remarkable happening in this Republican primary,” Cruz said, according to National Review’s Eliana Johnson. “Right now, the Washington establishment is abandoning Marco Rubio, they’ve made the assessment that Marco can’t win this race, and the Washington establishment is rushing over to support Donald Trump. We’re seeing that happen every day, and Mr. Trump is welcoming that support. ” Last night, Cruz made a similar argument in a recent interview, calling Trump part of the “Washington cartel. ” “The cartel exists to make deals and to pick winners and losers through cronyism and corporate welfare,” Cruz said in an interview with BuzzFeed’s Rosie Gray. “And so it’s no surprise that more and more of the establishment is beginning to support Donald Trump. Because Donald has promised to make deals and to continue the cronyism and corporate welfare of Washington. That’s what the cartel does. They make deals with Democrats. ” Cruz said that Trump was more likely to make deals with Democrats to help get things done. “Donald Trump said just yesterday that the problem with me is that I wouldn’t go to Washington to make a deal and go along to get along with the Democrats,” Cruz said in the interview. “If you’re looking for someone who’s a dealmaker, who’ll capitulate even more to the Democrats, who’ll give in to Chuck Schumer, Harry Reid, and Nancy Pelosi, then perhaps Donald Trump is your man. ”"
102,Kamala Harris to Replace Scalia on Supreme Court? - Breitbart,2016-02-16,"California Attorney General Kamala Harris may be on Barack Obama’s list of nominees to fill the Supreme Court vacancy left by Antonin Scalia’s death. [Various media outlets have mentioned Harris as as a prospective nominee, including the New York Times, Associated Press, USA Today, the National Law Journal and the SCOTUSblog, according to the Los Angeles Times.  Former Obama White House advisor David Axelrod has also mentioned Harris. Harris’ campaign spokesman Nathan Click dismissed the speculation, saying, “While the attorney general is honored to be mentioned in these conversations, she’s committed to her current job and continuing her fight for California families in the U. S. Senate. ” Obama has a special fondness for Harris, featuring her as a speaker at the Democratic National Convention in 2012 and once calling her “the  ” attorney general in the country. Harris champions leftist positions on virtually everything, including abortion, ending the federal ban on medical marijuana, easing a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants, and shorter sentences for some drug crimes. She notably refused to defend Proposition 8, which outlawed   marriage in California, saying it violated the Constitution. She defended the law forcing members of public employee unions to help pay for collective bargaining, and appealed the ruling against unions in Vergara vs. California. As San Francisco district attorney, Harris refused to press for the death penalty against a gang member who killed a police officer. Judge Paul Watford, another Californian, has also been mentioned by the New York Times and the Washington Post as a possible successor to Scalia. He clerked for Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, was nominated by Obama to be an appellate judge in 2011, and was confirmed by the Senate in 2012. He, like Harris, is African American.  "

[Following the news of the mass migrant rape scandal that has gripped Europe, Lutz Bachmann and his PEGIDA movement organised the “Rapefugees Not Welcome” protest this Saturday in Cologne, stressing the importance of Western culture and the freedom and protection of women.  But while the political establishment took four days to start getting to the bottom of the New Year’s Eve sexual assault orgy, they have wasted no time pursuing Mr. Bachmann for wearing a   that opposes rape by migrants. The Leipziger Volkszeitung newspaper has reported that Mr. Bachmann  —   who is no stranger to controversy  —   is being pursued by Green Party politician and lawyer Jurgen Kasek, who has called the   “sedition”.

105,Christina Hoff Sommers: ’Women are the Privileged Sex in Education’ - Breitbart,2017-03-01,"In an interview with The Dartmouth Review, Resident Scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, Christina Hoff Sommers, spoke about feminism, political correctness, and the state of free expression on college campuses. [In the interview, Sommers argued that girls and women are the privileged sex when it comes to educational status.  Girls and women are the privileged sex in education. From preschool to graduate school, and across ethnic and class lines, women get better grades, they win most of the honors and prizes, and they’re far more likely to go to college. Today women earn a majority of bachelor’s degrees and advanced degrees. Latino girls are now slightly more likely to attend college than white boys. When an education policy analyst looked at current trends in higher education he quipped, only half in jest, “The last male will graduate from college in 2068. ” Our schools have offered untold number of admirable and effective programs to strengthen girls in areas where they languished —  in sports, math, and science. Where are the programs to help boys in areas where they falter: reading, writing, grades, school engagement and college matriculation? So far Congress, schools of education, school boards and the Department of Education have looked the other way. She also argued that universities must move away from identity politics if they are to return to a place where all ideas are welcome to be explored."
106,EXCLUSIVE: RNC Condemns Bill Kristol’s Anti-Trump Third Party as ’Helping to Elect Hillary Clinton’ - Breitbart,2016-03-20,"WASHINGTON —  The Republican National Committee (RNC) is throwing cold water on pundit Bill Kristol’s efforts to form a third party to challenge Donald Trump in the general election. [Bill Kristol, son of Irving, is trying to get retired senator Tom Coburn or retired Texas governor Rick Perry to run independently if the GOP Establishment can’t figure out how to broker the convention in Cleveland to deny Trump the nomination.  RNC spokesman Sean Spicer told Breitbart News that “any effort to facilitate a third party ultimately is helping to elect Hillary Clinton. ” “The Republican Party must be united to take back the White House,” Spicer said. Kristol has been touting his potential third party on Twitter. The name of the third party: The   Republicans. https:  .   —   Bill Kristol (@BillKristol) March 20, 2016,  “If they’re going to do that, they’re going to do that but then you might as well just hand the election to Hillary Clinton or whoever runs,” Trump told George Stephanopoulos Sunday. “Frankly, the Republicans wouldn’t have even one percent chance of winning if that’s the case. So if they’re going to be stupid and they’re going to do that instead of embracing these millions of people who are coming in to vote, then they’re going to have to do that. And I’ll tell you what, that’s going to mean more than any other thing. It’s going to mean four or five justices, super liberal, placed on the Supreme Court. Our country will never, ever be the same. ” Kristol and his cohorts might not actually care if they help to elect Hillary Clinton. It will give the party’s power brokers a chance to stave off the populist takeover of their party as embodied by Trump’s rise, and they can presumably go back to picking the nominees again in 2020. This plot also eliminates Trump’s own   leverage. Trump can’t threaten to split the Republican vote in November if the party itself wants the vote split so Clinton can win. But before any   shenanigans occur, the Establishment is going to do everything it can to broker the convention in Cleveland. Trump needs to get 1, 237 delegates during primary season, which he thinks he can do “fairly easily,” in order to win the Republican nomination on the first ballot. If he doesn’t win on the first ballot, then many state delegates on later ballots can be freed from voting with their state and can form alliances to elect an Establishment candidate. John Boehner already said that he would support House Speaker Paul Ryan on a later ballot, and Ryan did not conclusively rule out the idea of accepting a brokered nomination. Trump supporter Chris Christie, who leads the Republican Governors Association, said recently that “I do not want to go back to the days of the 1800s and 1700s  …     where a bunch of, you know, legislators, no offense, pick the United States Senator or pick, you know, who is going to be the Presidential electors. ” “The fact is I like the way this system works and even though sometimes it has worked to my advantage and sometimes it has worked to my disadvantage,” Christie said in remarks at a press conference that were provided to Breitbart News by his office. “So, I do not, I think it is wrong, I do not think we should be disenfranchising people. People vote for who they want to vote for. The one who gets the most votes should be the one who gets to be the nominee, in my view. ” “It’s childish nonsense,” Newt Gingrich told Breitbart News, referring to a   brokered convention. “There are two potential presidential nominees. One is named Donald. One is named Ted. The idea that some clever Washington intellectual or power broker  —   put quote marks around ‘power broker’  —   can step into an election in which millions have voted and magically change the trajectory of history? It’s goofy. There’s two players standing. ” Conservative commentator Erick Erickson is also leading a group that wants a brokered convention and is working with former Bush administration official Bill Wichterman to try to get it done. But an effort is already underway by grassroots conservatives to stop the Establishment in its tracks. Breitbart News reported that Trump and Ted Cruz delegates in Tennessee are already forming an alliance to make sure that their convention votes go to either Trump or Cruz and will not end up going to an Establishment candidate."

[Principle David Frankel sent a note home to parents saying, “Students were instructed that physical contact including tag games, touch football, etc. were not allowed on the yard. ”  Why would this   tradition of playground fun get the axe? According to school district spokesman Daniel Thigpen, things had gotten just a bit too physical. Thigpen explained, “In this case, kids were getting too rough  …    so the school told them to stop playing those games  …     It’s not uncommon for a school to enact specific recess rules to address specific behavior problems. ” Students will face disciplinary action should they not comply. The punishments will begin with a referral, and then a   conference, according to school officials.

Mallory Giddens is not a fan of the new rule. Giddens told KOVR television, “I don’t really like it. I mean I don’t really play tag but I don’t think it’s fair to everyone else that plays tag!” Giddens continued, “My principal, he doesn’t want us to have tag at school because people, they touch too hard.

World War II bomb was found there.  The bomb was discovered last week in Augsburg, during construction work on an underground car park. An evacuation area more than a mile (1. 5 kilometers) in radius was announced for December 25, including 32, 000 households and around 54, 000 inhabitants. Residents were told to be out of their homes by 10 a. m. at the latest, and evacuation centers were set up in local schools and gymnasiums. Just after 7 p. m. the city’s official Facebook account announced the bomb had been successfully defused and the evacuation was over. Photos showed Augsburg’s mayor, Kurt Gribl, going into the pit where the bomb was sitting to thank the work crews who had given up their Christmas to work on the explosive. ”Aircraft bomb disarmed    these brave men are the real heroes of this historical day. Thank you deep down from the heart,” Gribl said on his Twitter account. The city also confirmed in a statement that the bomb was a British one that had been dropped on the city in World War II. Authorities had previously decided to wait to defuse the device until Christmas, as there was no immediate danger from the bomb.  In Germany, families hold their main celebration on Christmas Eve, rather than Christmas Day as in many other Christian countries. More than 70 years after the end of the second World War, unexploded bombs are still causing problems across Europe. In August 2015, a 250 kilogram (550 pound) bomb was discovered on a construction site in East London, forcing a   evacuation while it was defused. One year earlier, in January 2014, a bulldozer struck an unexploded bomb in Euskirchen, Germany, killing one person and injuring others."

112,NRA will comment on Philando Castile’s death following investigation,2016-07-08," (CNN) Critics are calling out the National Rifle Association for not quickly coming to the defense of Philando Castile, who was fatally shot by a police officer in Minnesota this week after reportedly acknowledging that he had a weapon and a concealed carry permit. ”Where is the gun rights lobby?” wrote Amanda Marcotte on Salon. com of Castile’s case and that of Alton Sterling, who was shot and killed by police in Louisiana after a 911 caller said he brandished a gun. ”Here are two American citizens that were killed while doing what the NRA claims is a constitutional right. Surely this must be a gross injustice in the eyes of the NRA! Surely they will be demanding action, petitioning congressmen, demanding the Department of Justice to step forward and make sure that every American has a right to arm themselves without fear of being gunned down by the police! Right?” Castile’s fiancée   the immediate aftermath of the shooting, showing Castile slumped against the driver’s seat, with blood soaking through his shirt. She says he told the officer he had a gun and a permit, but police have not commented on the events that led up to the shooting. But Friday afternoon    almost two days after Castile was killed    the NRA posted a statement on Twitter. It did not mention him by name. ”As the nation’s largest and oldest civil rights organization, the NRA proudly supports the right of   Americans to carry firearms for defense of themselves and others regardless of race, religion or sexual orientation.  ”The reports from Minnesota are troubling and must be thoroughly investigated. In the meantime, it is important for the NRA not to comment while the investigation is ongoing.  ”Rest assured, the NRA will have more to say once all the facts are known,” the statement said. CNN cannot independently confirm that Castile had a   permit, as his family has said. Officials with the Minnesota Department of Public Safety and the Hennepin County Sheriff’s Office told CNN such data is private under state law. ”Under Minnesota law, information about an individual’s ’permit to carry’ status is not public,” Bruce Gordon, communications director for the Minnesota Department of Public Safety, said in an email. Before the NRA statement was posted Friday afternoon, the group took a lot of heat for its silence. Cam Edwards, who hosts an NRA podcast, seemed to raise questions about the situation. ”Our right to keep and bear arms is not based on the color of our skin,” Edwards said. ”It’s not based on how much money we make, it’s not based on where we live. .. that’s what our rights are based on, those protections that are enshrined in the Constitution    not granted by the Constitution, but protected by the Bill of Rights.” Others were angered when the NRA maintained its early silence on Castile’s death, in particular, but posted a statement from CEO and Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre regarding the killings of five police officers in Dallas on Thursday night    killings that came during a largely peaceful protest of the deaths of Castile, Sterling and other   during encounters with police. ”On behalf of the more than five million members of the National Rifle Association, and especially on behalf of our members from the law enforcement community, I want to express the deep anguish all of us feel for the heroic Dallas law enforcement officers who were killed and wounded, as well as to those who so bravely ran toward danger to defend the city and the people of Dallas,”  the statement read. ”With heavy hearts, NRA members honor their heroism and offer our deepest condolences to all of their families.” Some commenters were angry there was still no mention of Castile at the time of its statement on the police deaths. ”I really am not trying to rock the boat but no words about Philando Castile? This whole week has been a mess for every side at least say something,” wrote Kris Taylor on Facebook. ”Stop hiding behind political correctness and pride and who supports who to open your eyes that there is a serious conversation that needs to happen and it starts with establishments of influence like National Rifle Association.” Others supported the organization. ”The NRA represents ALL law abiding gun owners,” wrote Jodie L Dine."
113,Buchanan on ‘Russiagate’: Only Known Crimes Committed Are Leaks to Media,2017-03-21,"Columnist Pat Buchanan asks why greater emphasis isn’t being placed on the leaking of classified intelligence to the media concerning the investigation of alleged connections between the Trump campaign and the Russians. If FBI director Comey is unwilling to investigate these illegal leaks, Buchanan suggests a special counsel should. [From Buchanan’s latest column:  Is the FBI investigating the intelligence sources who committed felonies by illegally disclosing information about the Trump campaign? Comey would not commit to investigate these leaks, though this could involve criminal misconduct within his own FBI. Again, the only known crimes committed by Americans during and after the campaign are the leaks of security secrets by agents of the intel community, colluding with the Fourth Estate, which uses the First Amendment to provide cover for criminal sources, whom they hail as “whistleblowers. ” Indeed, if there was no surveillance of Trump of any kind, where did all these stories come from, which their reporters attributed to “intelligence sources”? Attorney General Jeff Sessions has recused himself from any role in the Russian hacking scandal. But the Justice Department should demand that the FBI put the highest priority on investigating the deep state and its journalistic collaborators in the sabotage of the Trump presidency. If Comey refuses to do it, appoint a special counsel. Read the rest here. "
114,"When It Comes to a Veil, Brides Can Take It or Leave It - The New York Times",2016-04-23,"Molly Guy, the owner of Stone Fox Bride, a SoHo bridal shop, often finds herself catering to an unconventional client, one inclined to tweak or entirely dispense with tradition  —   and with it the wearing of a wedding veil. That bride, she said, “can barely stomach the idea of wearing a white dress, let alone a veil. ” Another type, Ms. Guy said, is more likely to conform. “Her mother and grandmother got married in a veil, and she will adhere to tradition. ” Yet a third, she said, reads Vogue and doesn’t care about the traditional: “She loves the accessory element of a veil. ” Whichever type of bride  —   in favor, opposed or simply on the fence  —   her decision to wear a veil, or reject it, is apt be fraught, heavily weighted by considerations of faith, family pressures, feminist principles and the no less compelling dictates of style. But what sets this bride apart from her mother’s generation is a ringing conviction that wearing a veil is less often a matter of custom than it is one of personal choice. Allison Shoening, 33, of Centennial, Colo. a project manager for a law firm, is to marry in September. She chose to wear a veil with the blusher, the portion that covers her face. “I struggled with the decision myself for a while,” Ms. Shoening said. “Over all, I like the look of a veil. It adds an   element to my wedding. ” And a wisp of decorum. “If I go strapless, I want to keep my look balanced,” she said. “I just don’t want everything bare. ” Others drop the veil, or at least the blusher, dismissing these elements as relics of male oppression, about as unwelcome on one’s wedding day as a pair of manacles. When she married four years, ago, Jessica Huseman, 26, left her head bare. “My   and I both find the idea of a veil to be a little silly,” she said. Pointedly, Ms. Huseman said: “We had this mutual agreement to share our lives. It was troubling, if you saw marriage as a partnership of equals, to wear a veil. ” “The idea of my husband lifting a veil over my face as his possession in front of our family and friends would have made me feel objectified,” she said. Those saying no to the veil included a number of women with deeply held religious convictions and strong family ties. Emily Dause, 30, who grew up in a family of evangelical Christians, saw no betrayal of her faith in replacing the veil with a headband for her coming May wedding. “It seemed to me that a veil is connected to being seen as a package, something to be given away on her wedding day,” said Ms. Dause, a teacher from Mechanicsburg, Pa. “It was disturbing that the veil has been viewed historically as connected to superstitions about warding off demons. ” She and others also see the veil as a symbolic reference to the virginity of the bride. Some brides sidestep the issue entirely, said Alexis Swerdloff, the    editor of New York Weddings. She said they replace the frothy length of cloth with a smaller, more discreet head covering, something like the birdcage (a small veil that cups the face) or the more   fascinator, an ornamental headpiece customarily embellished with a wisp of tulle extending slightly over one eye. Such choices tend to be governed less by custom than by taste. Wearing a fascinator, or alternately, a garland of flowers or   comb, “is a way of saying, ‘Oh, so, I’m a modern, cool bride, and I just like the way this looks,’” Ms. Swerdloff said. Meghan Boledovich, a restaurant forager at Print in New York, plans to wear a small veil when she marries in July. “I would wear it mostly because of how it looks,” she said. According to the Wedding Report, which tracks industry trends, based on government data and surveys of couples, the average amount spent on dress accessories (mostly veils, but other items, too) was $226 in 2015, a drop of 1. 3 percent from 2014. In a   culture, it’s not surprising that brides favoring the veil tend to be swayed by images of   muses like Princess Grace of Monaco, Bianca Jagger, Stevie Nicks or more contemporary figures, like Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, or Jerry Hall, who married Rupert Murdoch in March with her head covered by a cloud of lavishly embroidered tulle. As with many stylistic choices, “These things really come down to what people seeing in magazines, on blogs and on the runway,” said Ms. Guy of Stone Fox Bride. For inspiration, she refers her clients to a roster of hip role models, Gwen Stefani and Solange Knowles, among others, never mind that on her wedding day, Ms. Knowles had subbed the veil for a     white cape. Lindsay Short, a senior accessories buyer for David’s Bridal in Conshohocken, Pa. said she is seeing an uptick in brides who wear veils. “In particular to a return to the cathedral veil,” she said. “Our customer tends to be the bride that wants the ball gown and the fairy tale. ” A recent resurgence of   formfitting gowns calls for the trailing veil and train, Ms. Short said. “It gives her that showstopping moment many brides still dream of. ” Kristen Maxwell Cooper, the executive editor of The Knot, said surveys last year of brides who use that   website showed that 57 percent bought a veil. In contrast, in 2013, only 31 percent of the brides surveyed said they bought one. “Sometimes choosing to wear a veil has nothing to do with tradition,” Ms. Cooper said. “The feeling is that it’s just something beautiful. If you’re going to wear it, it’s now or never. ” Mara Urshel, an owner of Kleinfeld Bridal in Brooklyn, said that the company is selling as many veils as it did four or five years ago, despite price increases: Some cost $6, 000 or $7, 000, or even as much as $10, 000, for the type of elaborately embellished variations some luxury houses now offer to match their gowns. (Veils more typically start at $300 and may go up to $2, 500.) Ms. Swerdloff, who skipped the veil at her own wedding this month, was somewhat startled to discover that, contrary to her expectations, most of brides who were photographed for New York Weddings’ spring 2016 issue did indeed wear a veil. So eager were some New Yorkers to make a style splash on their day of days, they insisted on wearing an ultralong veil, once relegated to the formal setting of a church or palatial estate, in the most informal surroundings. “I’ve seen a lot of long veils on   brides wearing short dresses, and getting married in a community garden,” Ms. Swerdloff said. For some    an elaborate veil remains the single most effusive expression of a long cherished fantasy. “I always imagined I would wear a cathedral veil,” said Allison Appell Cohen, 27, an account manager for Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas in Dallas. “Every girl wants to be princess for a few hours,” Ms. Cohen said. “The veil is a statement maker, it’s so regal. Just to have it and the train of my dress trailing behind me: I knew that’s what I wanted. ” Others, loath to sacrifice tradition, cling to the veil’s symbolism. Karen Salva, 28, a location scout and makeup artist in the film industry, was married this month in Mystic, Conn. in a   Jewish ceremony, her face and hair concealed. “As I got to the huppah,” she recalled, “my mother lifted the veil up and presented my husband to me. ” Benjamin Stern, her fiancé, had covered her face with the blusher veil, a variation on a Jewish wedding custom known as the badeken. Ms. Salva was moved: “It was symbolically a way of for him to say: ‘Let me do this one last thing for you. Let me protect you and shelter you. ’” Posting on the wedding blog “Love My Dress,” Jennifer Cranham commented that she initially hesitated to wear a veil. “But now, it’s one of the things I’m most excited about,” said Ms. Cranham, who will marry this year. Her mother was as well. Ms. Cranham wrote that when she tried on her veil in the fitting room, her mother gazed at her raptly. “The dress didn’t get tears,” Ms. Cranham said. “But the veil did. ”"
115,Yates: ’There was nothing casual about this’,2017-05-16," (CNN) Former acting Attorney General Sally Yates on Tuesday shot down the White House’s efforts to downplay the severity of her warnings about former national security adviser Michael Flynn. ”There was nothing casual about this,” Yates said in an interview with CNN’s Anderson Cooper, reacting to White House press secretary Sean Spicer’s assertion that her warning about Flynn’s interactions with Russian representatives was a ”heads up.”  ”I absolutely did not use the term heads up,” Yates told Cooper. ”I called (White House counsel) Don McGahn and told him I had a very sensitive matter I need to discuss with him that day in person.”  The exclusive interview, which aired in its entirety Tuesday evening, was Yates’ first on television since being fired by President Donald Trump. It was taped on Monday morning, prior to an explosive report by The New York Times that Trump had asked ousted FBI Director James Comey to end the investigation into Flynn.  Earlier this month, Yates testified in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee’s Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism regarding the Trump campaign’s alleged ties to Russia, particularly Flynn’s contact with Russian Ambassador to the US Sergey Kislyak.  Prior to Trump taking office, Flynn had discussed sanctions with the official.  During her testimony she said that, at the end of January, after reading the details of a Flynn interview with the FBI, she had called McGahn and warned him that Trump’s national security adviser could easily become a blackmail target for Russians based on the answers Flynn gave to the FBI. Responding to a question from Cooper on whether she agreed with the White House line that Flynn was dismissed over a ”trust issue” rather than a legal one, she said, ”I don’t know how the White House reached the conclusion that there was no legal issue. It certainly wasn’t from my discussion with them.”  She demurs on whether she thought that his contact with Russian officials was a fireable offense.   ”Whether he is fired or not is a decision by the President of the United States to make, but it doesn’t seem like that’s a person who should be sitting in the national security adviser position,” she said.  Five things we learned from the Sally Yates hearing, Urgency, Yates told Cooper that she expected the White House to act urgently on information that she had given the administration that Flynn had been compromised by his contact with Russian officials prior to Trump’s inauguration.  ”We expected the White House to act,” she said. When asked by Cooper if she expected the administration to act quickly, Yates replied, ”Yes.”  ”There was an urgency to the information?” Cooper clarified. ”Yes,” Yates said. Flynn remained in his position for 18 days after Yates had informed the administration about her concerns over his conduct.  Preet Bharara, Sally Yates and James Comey: Fired while investigating Donald Trump, Let go, Yates, who was appointed by President Barack Obama, was fired as acting attorney general at the end of January when she refused to defend the President’s first attempt at a ban on travelers and refugees entering the US from a number of   countries.  She was dismissed for ”refusing to enforce a legal order designed to protect the citizens of the United States,” the White House said at the time. ”(Yates) has betrayed the Department of Justice,” the White House statement said. Yates also denies that she was behind the leaking of a story to The Washington Post about Flynn’s calls with Kislyak, which led to his dismissal. ”Absolutely not. I did not and I would not leak classified information,” she told Cooper. She said that she was ”concerned” that her information appeared not to be acted upon, but concedes that ”something else” might have been done ”that maybe I just wasn’t aware of.” Asked what she thought of a tweet from Trump ahead of her appearance before the Senate committee, seemingly accusing her of leaking the story to the Post, she said that it was just one of ”a number of tweets that have given me pause.” Before she refused to defend the travel ban, Yates said she considered resigning. ”The bottom line is I felt like resigning would have protected my personal integrity, but not the integrity of the Department of Justice,” she said. Ultimately, she told Cooper, she has no regrets about her decisions during her tenure as acting attorney general. But Yates said she does not plan on getting into politics, despite rumors that she may run for Georgia governor. "

Thursday on Fox News Channel’s “Fox  Friends,” Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) slammed those protesting against the results of last week’s election of Donald Trump.  Cruz pointed out the hypocrisy of the protesters, noting they had an expectation of Trump accepting the results of the election, whereas they have seemingly failed to do so. “We have seen hypocrisy on rank display from the left,” Cruz said. “All of the folks who jumped on their high horse and were lecturing   Trump, ‘You’ve got to accept the results of the election,’ look  —   these are now the idiots who are protesting in the street, laying their bodies down in front of cars and disrupting traffic. ” “We had an election,” he continued. “The people spoke. Democracy is a powerful, powerful way of choosing.

117,"House Republicans Urge Appropriators to Block Sanctuary City, Amnesty Funding in Spending Bills - Breitbart",2016-03-25,"  House Republicans are pressing appropriators to defund sanctuary jurisdictions that protect illegal immigrants by refusing to cooperate with federal immigration authorities. [In a letter to the committee heads that oversee Department of Homeland Security and Justice Department funding, the 42 lawmakers, led by Rep. Paul Gosar ( ) urge that their upcoming spending bills include language blocking funding from sanctuary cities.  “The concept of sanctuary city policies is in direct opposition to the Rule of Law,” the letter reads. “A nation of laws must enforce established law, not seek ways to skirt enforcement. Sanctuary cities defy federal immigration laws by harboring untold numbers of illegal immigrants and providing safe havens for criminals, many of whom are violent offenders. ” In addition to pressing for appropriators to defund sanctuary cities, Gosar marshaled lawmakers to press appropriators to include additional immigration items in their spending bills.   members signed onto Gosar’s letter seeking for appropriators to leverage certain DHS funding in order to pressure the administration into finishing the rest of the   border fence.   House member joined Gosar in a letter calling for the upcoming DHS spending bill to block funding for President Obama’s executive amnesty. “The House of Representatives  —   indeed, the legislative branch  —   must take a stand against these overreaching actions. Our constituents sent us to Washington to put a stop to this nonsense. The Founding Fathers meant for this hallowed body to be tied most closely to the will of the American citizenry. We must assert out constitutional power of the purse against the president. In doing so, the will of the people will be done,” the 36 lawmaker’s letter reads. Additionally, Gosar led 20 House members to block funding for the Central American Minors (CAM) program to fly Central American minors to the U. S. and 47 members joined Gosar to fully fund the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP)."
118,Carbon monoxide suspected in hotel pool death,2017-04-01," (CNN) A teenage boy died and 14 other people were hospitalized after guests at a southern Michigan hotel were found unconscious around an indoor pool. Fire officials said they believe the cause was carbon monoxide poisoning.   The 14 were taken to local hospitals Saturday, according to police in Niles, a town of about 11, 000 just north of the Indiana state line.   Jessica Hines, a spokeswoman for Lakeland Hospital there, told CNN one person was ”confirmed dead on arrival.” The Niles Police Department identified the deceased as    Bryan Douglas Watts of Niles. Eight other children were taken to Memorial Hospital in South Bend, Indiana, police said. Three were released by Saturday evening and the other five were reported in good condition Sunday at noon. They include five children found unconscious alongside Watts at the Quality Inn  Suites hotel pool. Their ages range from 12 to 14 years old, Niles police said. Another child, who police said had just left the pool area, was found unresponsive in a   room. Five first responders were also treated and released. Carbon monoxide levels were high, police say, Police responded to the hotel around 10 a. m. ET, according to CNN affiliate  . Police said that, when they arrived, carbon monoxide levels at the hotel were 800 parts per million, according to CNN affiliate  . US standards for carbon monoxide are 35 parts per million for a   exposure.   Niles Fire Department Captain Don Wise attributed the incident to a faulty pool heater. ”The ventilation system on the heater had issues. The exhaust was not functioning properly,” said Wise. ”Our mechanical inspector verified that. The hotel is shut down now until repairs are made.” He said the hotel’s pool room had no carbon monoxide detectors ”to the best of our knowledge.” Carbon monoxide is an odorless, colorless and tasteless gas that is produced when a fuel is burned. When too much carbon monoxide is in the air, it can replace the oxygen in red blood cells and can lead to tissue damage or death. Choice Hotels, which owns the Quality brand, released a statement about the incident, saying it is ”working closely with local officials to manage the situation. . .. Our highest priority is always the safety and   of our guests.”"

121,Trump Army secretary pick gave a lecture arguing against the theory of evolution ,2017-05-01," (CNN) President Donald Trump’s pick to be secretary of the Army, former army doctor Mark Green, is a   ”creationist” who delivered a lecture arguing against the theory of evolution.  Green’s views and past statements are facing scrutiny ahead of his confirmation hearing, which has yet to be scheduled. If confirmed, Green wouldn’t be the only prominent doctor and member of the Trump administration to reject evolution. HUD Secretary Ben Carson has also made similar arguments and once said the theory of evolution was encouraged by Satan. Green, a Tennessee state senator, has faced opposition from Democrats and LGBT groups over his past   comments. In one comment, from September, Green said, ”If you poll the psychiatrists, they’re going to tell you that transgender is a disease.” The National Academy of Sciences says that the theory of evolution ”is supported by so many observations and confirming experiments that scientists are confident that the basic components of the theory will not be overturned by new evidence.” The group adds, ”Because the evidence supporting it is so strong, scientists no longer question whether biological evolution has occurred and is continuing to occur. Instead, they investigate the mechanisms of evolution, how rapidly evolution can take place, and related questions.” Green rejects the conclusions of scientists in his lecture. In his 2015 speech to a church to Cincinnati titled ’Isn’t Evolution A Solution? Green dedicated nearly an hour to explaining why his work as a medical doctor taught him to reject the theory. Green claims that the theory of evolution violates physical law, using the example of a lawn mower left out in a backyard. ”The evolutionists have their bad argument, too,” Green said. They say, ’Well, I can’t explain how it went from this to incredibly complex, so it must have been billions of years.’ That’s kind of where they put their faith. The truth of the matter is is the second law of thermo fluid dynamics says that the world progresses from order to disorder not disorder to order. ”If you put a lawn mower out in your yard and a hundred years come back, it’s rusted and falling apart. You can’t put parts out there and a hundred years later it’s gonna come back together. That is a violation of a law of thermodynamics. A physical law that exists in the universe.” Green also argues that processes allowing human life, such as   are ’irreducibly complex’ and says that is evidence of a creator. ”Irreducible complexity is important in the argument for the creationist because of this: Evolution assumes a series of minuscule changes over time, and each change has to give a survival advantage to the organism. If it doesn’t, and it causes a disadvantage the organism dies and evolution ends,” Green said.  Later in the speech, Green adds, ”The question is, did all of this happen by chance operating inside the laws of chemistry and physics? Or is this unbelievable engineering, and is the scientific mind going to look at it and make the conclusion, observation, and conclusion that it was created and not that it evolved. Again, remember time is not the hero of the plot. Time is the villain, because over time things break down, they don’t assemble themselves together.” Green did not respond to a request for comment. A White House spokesperson told CNN’s KFile that a spokesperson handling Green’s nomination would contact them, but Green’s spokesperson did not. In a statement announcing his nomination in early April, Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis put his full support behind Green. ”He had my full support during the selection process, and he will have my full support during the Senate confirmation process. I am confident of Mark’s ability to effectively lead the Army,” Mattis said. "
122,OBAMA: Leaked Trump tape shows that he’s ’insecure’,2016-10-10,"’  ’ ’   President Barack Obama on Sunday called the shocking leaked 2005   recording of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump    ”by the    ” a sign of the Manhattan   billionaire’’s insecurity. ’ ’   The recording of Trump, which was picked up by a hot mic and    on Friday, came from an   interaction between Trump and television personality Billy Bush.   In addition to his comments about grabbing women ”by the   ”   Trump made a litany of other sexually suggestive remarks. The   Post reported it came after Trump married his third wife,   Melania. ’ ’   ”One of the most disturbing things about this election is just   the unbelievable rhetoric coming at the top of the Republican   ticket,” Obama said at a fundraiser in Chicago. ”I don’’t need to   repeat it. There are children in the room.” ’ ’   ”But demeaning women, degrading women, but also minorities,   immigrants, people of other faiths, mocking the disabled,   insulting our troops, insulting our veterans,” he continued,   naming a list of prior controversial Trump comments. ”That tells   you a couple things. It tells you he is insecure enough that he   pumps himself up by putting other people down. Not a character   trait that I would advise for somebody in the Oval Office.” ’ ’   The president said the tape showed that Trump ”doesn’’t care much   about the basic values we try to impart to kids.” ’ ’’ ’   Trump addressed the matter in a Friday statement, in which he   called the comments ”locker room banter” and added that former   President Bill Clinton has said ”far worse to me on the golf   course.” ’ ’   That was later followed by a   video address, offering a   brief apology and saying he looked forward to the Sunday   night presidential debate. He posted a tweet Saturday morning to   call the past day ”certainly . .. interesting.” ’ ’   Almost immediately, Trump came under fire from those on both   sides of the aisle  —   as many top Republicans either strongly   condemned the comments or unendorsed the Manhattan billionaire   altogether. ’"

[In an Instagram post on Wednesday, the    “Vogue” singer took her “ageist” and “sexist” critics to task for failing to look beyond the simples aesthetics of the dress to see its deeper political meaning.  “[W]e are still in the dark ages,” Madonna wrote. “My dress at the Met Ball was a political statement as well as a fashion statement. The fact that people actually believe a woman is not allowed to express her sexuality and be adventurous past a certain age is proof that we still live in an   and sexist society. ” “I have never thought in a limited way and I’m not going to start,” she added. “We cannot effect change unless we are willing to take risks By being fearless and By taking the road leas traveled by [sic].

124,Mexican State’s New Court System Appears Broke and Not Ready for Implementation,2016-03-29,"PIEDRAS NEGRAS, Coahuila  —   Less than three months before this border state needs to fully implement a new judicial system, court officials claim that the courthouses are not only inadequate, but the funds for basic office needs have run dry. [Breitbart Texas traveled to the Mexican States of Tamaulipas and Coahuila to recruit citizen journalists willing to risk their lives and expose the cartels silencing their communities.  The writers would face certain death at the hands of the various cartels that operate in those areas including the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas if a pseudonym were not used. Breitbart Texas’ Cartel Chronicles are published in both English and in their original Spanish. This article was written by Coahuila’s “JM Martinez” and Breitbart Texas’ Ildefonso Ortiz.   It remains unclear what happened to the judicial funding. The U. S. government provided $68 million in aid to Mexico in 2014 in an effort to get the new judicial system up an running.  This border state is one of the states that, according to court officials who spoke out to Breitbart Texas, continues to lag behind with employes having to purchase office supplies out of their own pocket. Breitbart Texas visited the border city of Piedras Negras where the state does have one courthouse with two small courtrooms for the trials. However, high ranking officials with the Coahuila Attorney General’s Office who spoke with this reporter stated that they have not been provided with the bare essentials to keep the courthouse running.  One clerk that spoke out under the condition of anonymity stated that his office doesn’t even have paper and he had to provide his own materials.  When it comes to the logistics, Coahuila was originally scheduled to have one courthouse in each of it’s six judicial regions. Breitbart Texas was able to only locate three courthouses, one in Saltillo, one in Piedras Negras, one in Monclova. A command level state police officer that spoke with this outlet confirmed that the lack of courthouses has resulted in police officers having to transport prisoners from throughout the state to the three courthouses in the state.  According to various police sources in Coahuila, prisoners from Ciudad Acuna and Sabinas are transported in police convoys to the courthouses in Piedras Negras and Monclova respectively due to the lack of courtrooms in their particular jurisdiction.  In 2014, the U. S Agency for International Development known as USAID provided Mexico with $68 million in aid for the implementation of a series of reforms that would turn that country’s judicial system from one that had written trials to one with public oral trials. The move is part of the ongoing Merida Initiative or Plan Merida which provides aid to Mexico in an effort to stem the growth of organized crime in that country. The funds that were received by Mexico were then to be disbursed to the 31 states in that country in an effort to help the transition.  The judicial reform in Mexico has been widely promoted by that country’s federal government since it is set to add some transparency to a judicial process that is largely perceived to be full of corruption.  According to the information published by Mexico’s Secretariat of the Interior,  the new judicial system is set to be fully operational on June 18, 2016. However, the process has been plagued with delays. Mexico’s El Universal reported in early 2015, that at the time, only six states in the country had achieved a 60 percent implementation rate. Last October, Coahuila’s El Zocalo Newspaper interviewed a local congressman who warned that Coahuila continues to lag behind in the implementation of the judicial system.  “Our judicial system has been in crisis for years, we don’t need more improvements, the learning curve is intolerable,” Congressman Leonel Contreras was quoted by Zocalo. “The delivery of justice is not a game, we can not take the luxury of taking the liberty of innocents and letting criminals go free. ” "
125,"Ayotte says Trump ’absolutely’ a role model for kids in NH debate, later says she misspoke",2016-10-04,"Washington (CNN) New Hampshire GOP Sen. Kelly Ayotte said during a debate on Monday that she would ”absolutely” point to Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump as a role model for a child. She issued a statement after the debate saying she ”misspoke.” The   senator was asked by a moderator during the NECN debate: ”Would you tell them to be like Donald Trump? Would you point to him as a role model?”  ”I think that certainly there are many role models that we have, and I believe he can serve as president and so, absolutely. I would do that,” she said at the New England College hosted debate in Henniker, New Hampshire. In a statement afterward, Ayotte said: ”I misspoke tonight. While I would hope all of our children would aspire to be president, neither Donald Trump nor Hillary Clinton have set a good example and I wouldn’t hold either of them as role models for my kids.” Ayotte is currently locked in a hotly contested Senate reelection race against Democratic rival, Gov. Maggie Hassan. Ayotte has said she is voting for Trump, but not endorsed him for president. Ayotte has said that she will she will ”stand up” to Trump if he becomes president    but she will vote for him in November.  ”I will take on my own party,” Ayotte told CNN in Nashua in August. ”I really believe that this is a big issue in this race    that I am the one candidate that will stand up to whomever is in the White House to do good things when we can work together    also when it’s wrong to stand up to them.” During Monday’s debate, someone   asked Ayotte: ”If you think he can serve as president, why won’t you endorse him?”  ”Because I’ve had some disagreements with him,” she said. ”And I’ve been quite clear about those disagreements. And this is an area where Gov. Hassan has been lockstep with Secretary Clinton. I haven’t heard major disagreements that she’s had with Secretary Clinton so who’s going to step up for the people of New Hampshire?”  Since Trump launched his campaign last summer, he called some Mexicans ”rapists” during his announcement speech, said Sen. John McCain isn’t a ”war hero” because he was captured, proposed a temporary Muslim ban, mocked a disabled reporter during a campaign rally, repeatedly made harsh comments about women, and attacked the Khans, a Gold Star family, for their comments at the Democratic National Convention. And at a rally in Pennsylvania this weekend, Trump hit Clinton on her ”stamina,” said that Clinton is not ”loyal” to her husband, former President Bill Clinton, and called her an ”incompetent” and ”sarcastic woman.”  In the past, Ayotte has been heavily critical on Trump’s controversies, including his attacks against the Khan family.  When Trump was asked about Ayotte in an August Washington Post interview, he criticized her lack of support and implied she was weak. ”You have a Kelly Ayotte, who doesn’t want to talk about Trump, but I’m beating her in the polls by a lot. You tell me. Are these people that should be representing us?” he said. ”We need loyal people in this country. We need fighters in this country. We don’t need weak people. We have enough of them.”"
126,Junior Seau daughter to speak at Hall of Fame,2015-08-02," (CNN) After a week of controversy, the daughter of the late NFL star Junior Seau will speak on stage during her father’s induction at the Pro Football Hall of Fame, the hall’s president said in a written statement. Sydney Seau had been told she would only be a part of a video tribute to her father and would unveil his bronze bust, but wouldn’t speak to the audience live. The decision was based on   old policy, officials from the Hall of Fame said. But Saturday, Fox Sports first reported Sydney Seau would be interviewed about her father during the ceremony next Saturday.  ”Our goal is to maintain our policy regarding enshrinement speeches, but also show compassion and understanding,” Pro Football Hall of Fame President David Baker said in a statement. When Sydney Seau unveils her father’s bust she will be joined by her two brothers and her half brother. The Hall of Fame said Sydney Seau’s presentation speech will be included in the video, which will be two times longer than the tributes for the other inductees. Seau was 43 when he killed himself in May 2012 and was posthumously diagnosed with chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a brain disease that can result from repeated head trauma. His case was among those that increased scrutiny of NFL policies regarding concussions and player safety. The circumstances surrounding Seau’s death are not expected to be mentioned in the presentation. Seau’s family filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the league in 2013. Junior Seau wanted Sydney, 21, to present him if he were ever chosen for the Hall of Fame, and a news release from the organization earlier this month implied that Sydney would indeed be the presenter.   Sydney Seau expressed frustration to The New York Times at not being able to speak at the event:  ”I just want to give the speech he would have given.  It wasn’t going to be about this mess.  My speech was solely about him.” After the Times article, football writers and fans criticized the policy that would keep her from giving a live speech.    A Hall of Fame spokesman told CNN last week that the original decision to not have the family speak was made ”strictly on the policy” and ”has nothing to do with any other circumstances.” The Hall of Fame had said it was following a policy initiated in 2010.  According to a statement released last week, the ceremony features ”expanded presenting video (longer than the videos of living inductees) followed by the traditional unveiling of the bronzed bust and no additional comments made from the podium.” Honorees who are alive give a speech after their tribute videos.   In April, a federal judge approved a settlement to a lawsuit by more than 5, 000 former NFL players who accused the league of hiding the dangers of concussions.  For players who retired by July 7, 2014, the settlement provides up to $5 million for serious health effects associated with head trauma. Seau’s family had opted out of this lawsuit, choosing to pursue a settlement independently. A player who was once nicknamed the ”Tasmanian Devil” for the intensity of his playing style, Seau was known for his willingness to keep playing despite pain and injuries.  His friend and former NFL player Donald McPherson said players such as Seau operated under the mentality, ”Ignore pain, leave it on the field and never back down.”   His Hall of Fame induction honors a career spanning 20 seasons for the Chargers, Dolphins and Patriots. He was an   first team  . Junior Seau is the second player to be inducted posthumously. Former Los Angeles Rams     Les Richter was honored in 2011. His son, Jon, appeared in the tribute video but didn’t speak at the ceremony. "
127,Michelle Obama Denounces Donald Trump in CUNY Commencement Speech - The New York Times,2016-06-21,"In tones both aspirational and political, Michelle Obama on Friday used her last commencement address as first lady to salute graduates of the City College of New York as “living, breathing proof that the American dream endures,” while also criticizing “ ” leaders who engage in “anger and intolerance. ” Mrs. Obama did not specifically mention Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president. But her intent could not have been clearer as she warned that “leaders who rule by intimidation  —   leaders who demonize and dehumanize entire groups of people  —   often do so because they have nothing else to offer. ” “Here in America, we don’t give in to our fears,” she told the class of 2016, with its 3, 848 graduates, in an outdoor ceremony on the college’s Manhattan campus. “We don’t build up walls to keep people out because we know that our greatness has always depended on contributions from people who were born elsewhere but sought out this country and made it their home. ” For Mrs. Obama, the address, the last of her three commencement speeches this year, was intended to highlight several issues that have been dear to her, including public education and immigration. Noting the college’s proximity to the Statue of Liberty, she said there was “no better way to celebrate this great country than being here with you. ” Mrs. Obama’s commencement address at City College, the flagship school in the City University of New York system, was the latest high point in its long, distinguished history. In 1847, it was founded as the Free Academy of New York, with a mission to provide an education to anyone, at low cost. But her visit also came at a precarious time for the CUNY system, which has been troubled by overcrowded classes, shrinking course options and budget cuts, as described in a recent investigation by The New York Times. Faculty members and employees represented by the university’s biggest union, who have worked without a raise for six years, recently voted to authorize a strike in the fall if no contract deal was reached. Indeed, dozens of faculty and students on Friday morning handed out fliers to people filing past security to enter the campus, in Upper Manhattan, urging public officials to invest more money in the system. None of the speakers at the commencement directly addressed CUNY’s woes. But in her   address, which elicited frequent and enthusiastic applause, Mrs. Obama said that “public education is our greatest pathway to opportunity in America. So we need to invest in and strengthen our public universities today, and for generations to come. ” At several points, she mentioned notable immigrants, or the children of immigrants, who had attended City College, including Jonas Salk, Ira Gershwin, Colin L. Powell and Andrew S. Grove, the former Intel chief executive, who died in March. But she also applauded the valedictorian and salutatorian of the graduating class, who delivered rousing addresses on the importance of diversity and the   battle to break cultural barriers. Mrs. Obama added some personal perspective, as well: “It’s the story that I witness every single day when I wake up in a house that was built by slaves, and I watch my daughters  —   two beautiful, black young women  —   head off to school, waving goodbye to their father, the president of the United States, the son of a man from Kenya who came here to America for the same reasons as many of you: to get an education and improve his prospects in life. ”"

Pirro said Obama is “  in the leftist political ideology” when it comes to gun control, while he should be focused on protecting Americans and letting them defend themselves. “Mr. President, the issue is terrorism, not mass shootings. And yet, because of a political agenda, you refuse to the biggest danger that we face. Instead of blaming guns, why don’t you start shooting terrorists? Now, maybe you don’t have time to focus on this because you’re too busy emptying Guantanamo and trading deserters for Taliban generals. And as a result of your   in the leftist political ideology, you should be focused on protecting us and letting us defend ourselves.

129,Donald Trump: Time For Law Enforcement To Start Profiling Radical Muslims - Breitbart,2016-09-19,"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump wants American law enforcement to start profiling radical Muslims and stop being politically correct about the terrorist threat Americans face. [“You’ll never solve the problem if you’re afraid to use the real name. This is radical Islamic terrorism,” he said, after a bomb went off in New York City and injured 29 people. Over the weekend, law enforcement officials discovered and diffused several bombs placed around the city.  Trump praised law enforcement for doing an excellent job combating terrorism in America’s cities, but suggested that political correctness was getting in the way. He cited the security measures by Israel as an example. “In Israel they profile, they’ve done an unbelievable job, as good as you can do,” Trump said. “They profile. They see somebody that is suspicious, they will profile, they will take that person in, they’ll check out. Do we have choice? Look what’s going on? Do we really have a choice?   …     This is only going to get worse. ” Law enforcement are currently seeking the whereabouts of    Ahmad Khan Rahami, an American citizen of Afghan decent for questioning about the attacks.  Trump ridiculed President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton on Monday, criticizing them for being weak on terror and failing to address the source of terrorism because of political correctness. “Our leaders are  —   I don’t even say ‘weak,’  —   I say ‘stupid,’” he said in an interview on Fox and Friends. Trump warned that these kinds of attacks would continue, as long as Obama and the Democrats continued to welcome additional refugees from Syria into the United States and fail to destroy ISIS overseas. “We’ve been weak, our country has been weak,” Trump said, calling Syrian refugees “cancer from within. ” Trump said that ISIS was started by Hillary Clinton and Obama after they exited Iraq, leaving terrorist elements the freedom to rebuild. “These are sick evil people that want to destroy this country, the way we coddle them, and the way we’re afraid to say anything, and we’re afraid to say what the problem is and who they are and they don’t want to say radical Islam they don’t want to talk about radical Islamic terrorism,” Trump said."
130,Kris Kobach Enters Kansas Governor Race to End ‘Insane’ Policies like Charging American Students Three Times as Much as Illegals,2017-06-09,"Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach discussed his gubernatorial campaign with SiriusXM host Matt Boyle on Friday’s Breitbart News Daily. [Kobach said taxation would be a core issue in his campaign.  LISTEN: “Some people may know Kansas. We did cut our income taxes quite a bit and reduced to zero the taxes on LLCs and S corporations a few years ago,” he said. “But a coalition of Democrats and liberal Republicans in the legislature just raised those taxes back up, doing so on the theory that they had to, to balance the budget. ” “I think that Kansas doesn’t have a revenue problem. It has a spending problem. We should have been cutting the budget,” he contended. On immigration, Kobach said Kansas is “a fairly conservative state, but our legislature hasn’t been conservative, and we’ve kind of become the sanctuary state of the Midwest. ” “We’re not formally a sanctuary state, but we do nothing to discourage illegal immigration,” he elaborated. “We give aliens   tuition. I want to stop that. ” Kobach noted Kansas is “one of the very few states west of the Mississippi that does not have term limits,” which he saw as vital to fighting corruption. “As a result, our legislators, some of them form entire careers in the state legislature. I’d like to see us have term limits for the legislature, as well as for the entire list of statewide offices,” he said. Kobach wryly conceded, “The left is not excited that I’m running” when Boyle noted the panoply of   groups denouncing his candidacy for governor. Boyle noted the left was fearful that Kobach really would put a stop to “unbelievable” policies like giving discounted   tuition rates to illegal immigrants. “It’s insane,” Kobach agreed. “I mean, think about it: You’ve got someone who lives in a neighboring state, say Missouri. A kid grows up there, wants to go to Kansas University or Kansas State, pays three times as much in tuition as an illegal alien. It makes no sense whatsoever. It’s against federal law. Congress was trying to stop this way back in the nineties they passed a law saying no state could do it, but several states did anyway. ” “We’re going to try to stop that. I think you just need a governor who will come in and say, ‘Look, I’m not budging. We’re going to do it, and we’re going to do it now, or we’re going to do it later, but we’re going to do it while I’m governor,’” he said, promising to “draw some lines in the sand and not let anyone cross them. ” Kobach laid out three major points in his   agenda. “One I already mentioned was term limits. Try to push term limits through. Now, that’s going to be a heavy lift since we don’t have the popular initiative. We’re going to have to push it through the legislature, and you know most politicians don’t like limiting their own terms in legislatures,” he said. “Second is pass a statute stopping the revolving door,” he continued. “Right now in Kansas, you can retire from the legislature, and then the next day, you can start lobbying your former colleagues. We’ll put time limits on how soon you can become a lobbyist in Kansas. You can become a lobbyist somewhere else if you want, but not in Kansas. ” Kobach said his third goal would be to achieve political transparency by replacing “Republicans in Name Only” who tend to side with Democrats. “We really have this problem very badly in Kansas,” he explained. “If you look at the numbers, our legislature in the Senate is 32 to 8  —   32 Republicans to 8 Democrats. Similar lopsided numbers in the House, over a   majority Republican. But many of those Republicans are truly RINOs  —   Republicans in Name Only. They vote with the Democrats all the time. When they go home, they talk like Republicans. They might even use the word ‘conservative’ to describe themselves. But then, they come in and become a completely different person when they are in the state legislature. ” “One of the things the governor has to do is actually call people out by name and say, ‘Look, I need this person’s vote’ and try to get the public aware of who these people are who are breaching the public trust,” said Kobach.  “If their district wants to elect someone who is liberal and votes with the Democrats, so be it. But there is a real deception going on. You see it in states like Kansas, where there are districts across the western part of our state which will not elect a Democrat, period. So what the Democrats do is, they just run as Republicans,” he said. Kobach agreed with Boyle that voters are tired of politicians who say one thing and do another. “I think they’re also tired of the politician who talks like everything he says is carefully polished and has gone through three focus groups,” Kobach added. “The thing that people loved about Trump is that he’s speaking from the gut. They could tell that this is what the guy really thinks. His speech wasn’t prepared and screened and reviewed by others, a bunch of     baloney, but is actually a guy telling us what he thinks. I think that’s important. ” “Nobody can do it like President Trump does it, but that’s kind of the way I have spoken to my constituents as secretary of state: ‘Here, this is what I’m going to do. I’m not going to beat around the bush. If you don’t like it, don’t vote for me,’” he said. Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m. Eastern.

131,Obama Ignores Three Attempts for Comment on Trump’s Appointment of Steve Bannon - Breitbart,2016-11-18,"President Barack Obama has dismissed three separate attempts by the media to get the president to criticize   Donald Trump’s decision to appoint Stephen K. Bannon to a top White House post. [One reporter questioned Obama about Bannon’s appointment during the president’s press conference on Monday in the White House briefing room, before his trip to Greece.  The reporter asked: What do you say to those Americans who may not doubt that there will be a peaceful transition but that are concerned about some of the policies and sentiments that were expressed by   Trump himself or his supporters that may seem hostile to minorities and others? Specifically, I’m talking about the announcement that Steve Bannon, who is a proponent of the     movement, what many call the white nationalist movement, is going to have a prominent role in the White House under President Trump as his chief strategist and senior advisor. What message does that send to the country, to the world? But Obama refused to engage with the ongoing criticism of Bannon, citing his responsibility to promote a smooth transition of power. “I think it’s fair to say that it would not be appropriate for me to comment on every appointment that the   starts making if I want to be consistent with the notion that we’re going to try to facilitate a smooth transition,” Obama replied. In Greece, Obama was asked during a press conference with Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, specifically about “the fact that Stephen Bannon was made as chief strategist” questioning whether the   could be a reliable partner with Europe as a result. Obama replied he was “cautiously optimistic” that Trump could shift from campaign mode to governing mode. “[T]here’s something about the solemn responsibilities of that office, the extraordinary demands that are placed on the United States, not just by its own people but by people around the world, that forces you to focus, that demands seriousness,” he said. Obama was again offered the chance to criticize Trump’s staff picks again during a press conference in Germany. “I’m wondering, as well, if you’ve advised your successor to be extra mindful of what you see as some very worrisome trends, particularly when it comes to making his own potentially powerful staff picks,” one reporter asked Obama during his press conference on Thursday with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Obama replied that Trump ran an “extraordinarily unconventional campaign,” that resulted in “the biggest political upset in perhaps modern political history. ” He admitted that Trump needed to unify the country with his decisions as president, but did not refer specifically to his staff choices. Obama is unique among Democrats in not outrightly condemning Bannon’s appointment, falsely accusing Trump of putting a white supremacist and a white nationalist into the White House. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid both blasted Bannon, demanding that Trump rescind his decision for Bannon to serve as his adviser. “If Trump is serious about seeking unity, the first thing he should do is rescind his appointment of Steve Bannon,” Reid said in a speech on the Senate floor. “Rescind it. Don’t do it. Think about this. Don’t do it. ” Pelosi denounced the decision in a statement to reporters on Monday. “Bringing Steve Bannon into the White House is an alarming signal that   Trump remains committed to the hateful and divisive vision that defined his campaign,” she said. Pelosi also asked Vice   Mike Pence for Donald Trump to reconsider his decision to appoint Bannon to his staff, during a private meeting at the Capitol."

135,Ann Coulter: Under En-Dowd,2017-01-18,"To celebrate Donald Trump’s inauguration this week, I’m returning to my new favorite parlor game: quoting Republican consultants on the 2016 campaign. [It never gets old! Also, this exercise reminds us of the many things we are thankful for this week: Donald Trump, the cluelessness of his opponents, and Nexis transcripts.  Our featured GOP consultant this week is Matthew Dowd, chief strategist for the   campaign and   Mr. Magoo. Nominally a conservative in a liberal business, Dowd couldn’t pull off a full Arianna, so if he wanted to sit in a warm studio on Sunday mornings issuing pronouncements as if from Mount Olympus, he had to come up with an act. Even a guy like Dowd  —   wrong on everything else, from the time of day to whether it’s raining  —   accurately sussed out what the media wanted: a   playing “the conservative. ” How else to explain the fact that the entire American media refused to have on anyone who supported the man who just won a landslide presidential election? The territory Dowd carved out for himself was: patriotic sage, above partisanship, announcing on every subject that both sides were wrong, he alone was right. This made him a regular panelist on ABC’s “This Week” with George Stephanopoulos. Dowd’s “both sides are wrong” offering to the   church was condescending and tiresome, but it would help if he were, from time to time, correct. Instead, from the moment Trump announced, Dowd treated us to hilariously boneheaded prognostications that were instantly proved wrong and never acknowledged as he issued each successive boneheaded prediction. On Feb. 7, 2016, Dowd pronounced that the nominations would be wrapped up in “April for the Democrats and May for the Republicans. ” Trump won the nomination by May 4 and Hillary won it in June  —   two months after Dowd’s confident prediction. On April 3, Dowd said Trump “can’t win a general election for all intents and purposes. ” (“For all intents and purposes” is what consultants add to   statements to make them sound weighty.) Trump won the election  —   and he won it with far more electoral votes than Dowd’s candidate ever got. On May 1, Dowd said, “It’s going to be a    election, unfortunately. ” Trump won both white men and white women, decisively. White women without a college degree carried the Midwest for Trump. (See here.) Dowd spent several Sundays in May assuring viewers that a   candidate would be on stage at the debates: “I think there is likely to be somebody else standing in the debates and that changes the dynamics. ” That never happened. After Trump wrapped up the nomination, Dowd claimed he had predicted it! “Well, I was very bullish on Donald Trump in the primaries,” he said on May 8. His use of the term “bullish” was, well,  . As for Trump winning the general election, Dowd declared it “unlikely. ” (Based on his fantastical recollections of his own predictions, I assume he is currently claiming to have predicted Trump’s win in the general election.) In the week leading up to the election, Dowd was a whirling dervish of soothsaying on Twitter: NOVEMBER 1, “@matthewjdowd Any expenditure of time or money by Trump in PA, VA, MI and NH is a total waste. Campaign mismanagement if they keep it up. ” Of the four states Dowd considered “a total waste” for Trump to campaign in, he won the two biggest, worth more than twice as many electoral votes as the other two combined  —   and one of those he lost by only 0. 3 percent. NOVEMBER 2, “@matthewjdowd clinton has a better chance of carrying Arizona than trump does of carrying Mi or Wi” Trump carried both Michigan and Wisconsin. Hillary did not win Arizona. NOVEMBER 4, “@matthewjdowd Look for sure signs Trump will lose: 1. ‘The only poll that matters is election day’ 2. ‘Our vote doesn’t show up in polls.’ 3. ‘Truman’” Although Trump never made any excuses  —   he won!  —   all three of those statements turned out to be true. (See Time magazine’s “Madam President” issue.) NOVEMBER 5 was Dowd’s Latino Appreciation Day: “@matthewjdowd even if Trump gets the exact % of votes of whites, blacks  Asians as Bush in 2004, Trump would lose by 3 million votes due to Latinos. ” “@matthewjdowd Trump will lose latino voters by a larger margin than romney. Who set a new modern low. ” “@matthewjdowd It looks like Trump campaign was right, the silent hidden vote is showing up: Latinos are voting at record levels. Motivated by Trump. ” Trump won more of the Hispanic vote than either McCain or Romney  —   and probably more than Bush, for whom we only have nonsense numbers (as both Republican and Democratic analysts agree  —   see here and here). NOVEMBER 6, “@matthewjdowd If trump loses Ohio and Florida one reason is that Clinton campaign head faked them into thinking he had chance in Michigan.  media helped” Trump won Michigan. Also Ohio and Florida. On Nov. 6  —   48 hours before the election  —   Dowd announced on ABC’s “This Week” that Trump would lose, “and lose badly. ” Bored with his own omniscience, Dowd explained, “George, to me, this election has been   …     incredibly predictable actually from the primary. ” Mr. Magoo had more wisdom to impart: “On election night, Hillary Clinton’s margins among nonwhite voters and among   voters are going to be the highest margins we’ve ever seen. ” Dowd’s sweeping declarations turned out to be less accurate than a blindfolded monkey throwing darts in a bar. On Twitter, Dowd assured his readers: NOVEMBER 7, “@matthewjdowd Clinton wins by five points. Over 300 electoral votes. Trump loses by more popular votes than Romney. ” Final electoral vote: Trump, 304 Clinton, 227. TV bookers couldn’t get enough of Dowd. What smugness! What monumental cluelessness! ABC’s “This Week” is a show famous for confronting guests with their own prior statements. Would ABC play this game with its own Powerhouse Roundtable prognosticators? Surely a man of Dowd’s integrity would come on the air and admit, “I couldn’t have been more wrong!” HELLO! That didn’t happen at all! Dowd was allowed to sit out the Sunday after the election. The following Sunday, he was in his usual seat on the Powerhouse Roundtable, right back to giving his sweeping, grinning predictions, with no acknowledgment that he had been spectacularly  —   and characteristically  —   wrong in every prediction he’d made, all year long. That’s why Dowd is our   Mr. Magoo. As Trump is being sworn in and visions of the wall are dancing in your head, remember that if he ever runs out of bricks, he can always use Republican consultants."
136,Profitable Pickups May Be in Cross Hairs of Trump Border Tax - The New York Times,2017-02-16,"DETROIT  —   There are many reasons for the steady success of the three major American automakers in recent years, but none are bigger than the surging sales of   pickup trucks. General Motors, Ford Motor and Fiat Chrysler dominate the segment in the United States market, and they rely on pickups for a sizable portion of their earnings in North America as a whole. But President Trump’s proposed border tax on imported vehicles could throw a wrench in the profit machine, particularly for G. M. and Fiat Chrysler, which build a large percentage of their pickups in Mexico. At the same time, Ford  —   which makes all of its pickups in American factories  —   would most likely benefit at the expense of its rivals. The Trump administration has pledged to levy tariffs of up to 35 percent on vehicles imported from Mexico and possibly elsewhere, primarily to prod automakers to increase production and jobs in the United States. In response, all three of the Detroit companies have announced plans for new investments in their American operations. Ford went a step further by canceling plans to build a $1. 6 billion plant in Mexico that had been criticized repeatedly by Mr. Trump. Yet the possibility of tariffs on trucks overshadows the    so far between a new president determined to expand the American economy and automakers that count on pickups as a huge source of income. “There is an awful lot at stake with a border tax on trucks,” said Michelle Krebs, an analyst with Autotrader. com, a   site. “These are the cash cows for Detroit. ” Pickup sales have been an important component of the consistent growth of the American auto market, which last year set a record with nearly 17. 5 million vehicles sold. The combination of low gas prices and a need by businesses to replace older trucks has stimulated demand, especially for   pickups, more than 90 percent of which are made by the three Detroit companies. In January, the three   vehicles in the nation were pickups: the Ford   G. M.’s Chevrolet Silverado, and Fiat Chrysler’s Ram model. The companies earn an estimated $8, 000 to $10, 000 in profit on each truck sold  —   compared with $3, 000 on a passenger car  —   so Detroit’s financial fortunes inevitably rise and fall on the success of their truck products. Yet for G. M. and Fiat Chrysler, much of that success is dependent on truck production in Mexico, where labor costs are significantly lower than in unionized factories in the United States. Industry analysts estimate that   of G. M.’s annual pickup production comes from its sprawling assembly plant in Silao, Mexico. And while Fiat Chrysler is expanding its American output of trucks, it still relies on its factory in Saltillo, Mexico, for 30 to 40 percent of its pickups, the analysts say. Ford, by contrast, makes its pickups at three plants in the United States. Automakers do not reveal profit margins on particular vehicles. But companies pay workers less than $10 an hour in Mexico, versus the top union wage of $29 in American plants. That differential makes Mexican trucks more profitable for G. M. and Fiat Chrysler than those produced in the United States. There are other costs associated with Mexican production, including shipping vehicles by rail or   to American dealerships. But lower labor rates still make Mexico an attractive production option for automakers. A border tax would wipe out that cost advantage, and could prompt manufacturers to raise prices on   vehicles. “Automakers could possibly eat the cost of a 5 to 10 percent tariff, but not a tax of 20 or 30 percent,” said Ron Harbour, an automotive analyst with the consulting firm Oliver Wyman. “They would probably have to pass some of that on to consumers. ” Higher prices could cool demand for pickups made by G. M. and Fiat Chrysler. The companies could also try to make up the cost of a border tax by spreading price increases across the breadth of their product lineups. While it is not uncommon to reallocate production among factories  —   for example, to make more   trucks in American plants and shift less profitable small cars to Mexico  —   it is expensive and   to do so. G. M. is also vulnerable to potential tariffs on imported parts for pickups made in its factories in Flint, Mich. and Fort Wayne, Ind. About 38 percent of the parts for all G. M. pickups are made in the United States and Canada, and 55 percent are produced in Mexico, according to statistics compiled by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. About 56 percent of the parts in Fiat Chrysler’s pickups are made in the United States and Canada, and 29 percent are produced in Mexico. At Ford, about 70 percent of its pickup components are made in the United States and Canada, and 15 percent come from Mexico. For all three automakers, that mix of parts applies whether the truck is made in the United States or Mexico. It is not clear whether Mr. Trump’s vision of a border tax would apply to parts or only finished products. One industry analyst, Colin Langan of UBS Securities, singled out G. M. in a recent research report for its vulnerability to a tariff on pickups. “The border tax is a clear risk to G. M.’s   pickup trucks,” Mr. Langan wrote. “The timing is also challenging as G. M. plans to retool its pickup facilities ahead of the 2018 pickup launch. ” G. M. executives declined to talk about the impact of a tariff on the company’s pickups during a conference call with analysts last week on its 2016 earnings. The company’s chief financial officer, Chuck Stevens, said it was premature to discuss the implications of a border tax. “There are a lot of moving parts,” he said. “We want to work with the administration to make sure what is best for the U. S. economy. ” G. M.’s chief executive, Mary Barra, stressed that about 80 percent of the products that the company sells in the United States are  . As a member of Mr. Trump’s business advisory council, Ms. Barra said, she has outlined how difficult it is for an automaker to adjust production strategy on the fly. “I think that understanding has been well received,” she said of meeting with the president and his advisers. Other vehicles made in Mexico, such as Ford’s Fusion sedan and G. M.’s Cadillac SRX sport utility vehicle, could also be affected by a border tax. But because of their popularity and profits, pickups are the most vulnerable products. “A tariff on pickups would be a real challenge, especially for G. M.,” said Ms. Krebs of Autotrader. “Trucks are so important to their bottom line, and this is uncharted territory. ”"

138,"Bringing doctors to rural Kenya, despite danger",2016-08-25,"Lamu, Kenya (CNN) The eastern coast of Kenya is riddled with danger. Once a   tourist destination, today people are being warned to stay away because of threats by Islamist terror group  . Others are fleeing the area for good. But Umra Omar keeps going back. In the remote area of islands near the   border, the Lamu Archipelago, aid groups have stopped working and infrastructures are crumbling. She and her group, Safari Doctors, travel by boat, road and air to bring medical care to people living along the insecure region. ”There is a lot of caution of, ’Why are you going here? You’re not supposed to,’ ” said Omar, 33. ”And as a woman running around pushing this project, it’s like, ’Why do that? Why not just stay home, get taken care of.’ ” Omar could have continued living the American dream she had worked so hard to carve out.  Raised in Kenya, she had earned degrees from two prestigious American schools, completed graduate school and was working   in Washington, D. C. But Omar says cubicle life wasn’t for her she was longing to return to her native country. ”When all is said and done, it feels like a lie to only work to get a paycheck,” said Omar, who moved home in 2010. ”It was kind of a sense of responsibility.” On a visit to her childhood community in the islands, she learned about a   medical aid project that had been abandoned because of the security concerns. Today, Safari Doctors provides free basic medical services    including immunizations, maternal health care and treatment for malaria and other common diseases in the region    to more than 1, 000 people a year. Despite the risk, and Omar’s current pregnancy, she makes   trips as much as possible to help those who desperately need it. CNN spoke with Omar about her work. Below is an edited version of the conversation. CNN: You now live   on one of the islands you also lived there as a young girl. What are these communities like? Umra Omar: We are identified as the Bajuni and the Boni communities who are the indigenous people. So we have people who’ve never stepped out of the village at all never, maybe, had an experience of running water. We have communities that, right now, have no schools within walking distance. Lamu is the only county in Kenya that has less than one kilometer of paved road.  The same thing that makes it beautiful, isolated and pristine, is the same thing that presents the challenges for access to health care. From the southernmost tip, which is in Lamu, all the way to the northernmost tip, that’s a   speedboat (ride) about $300. For the average person from Lamu, that’s not something you just cough up to run to the district hospital.  CNN: How does it all come together? Omar: We put together a trip for Safari Doctors like we would a   puzzle. You just have to know what the picture looks like to put it together.  We’re fortunate to be from a very intertwined area, from government all the way to the fishermen on a boat. And we at Safari Doctors are tapping into that to be able to fill some of the gaps in accessing health care. So it’s just a matter of us pulling in different pieces to see how we can work on this issue of accessing health care from the very basic level of getting medicines out to people to a more complex angle of bringing in consultants and professionals. CNN: Do you feel scared? Omar: Scared, no. It’s only dangerous if you feel really threatened. And frankly speaking, we don’t feel like we’re doing something that should warrant us being threatened or a target, because there’s no agenda other than life behind it. And if anybody feels like life is wrong, then there’s nothing we can do about it. CNN: You are 6 months pregnant and have a toddler at home. What keeps you going? Omar: So I’m pregnant, but not yet barefoot! And that’s supposed to be happening in November. But it’s something that I feel like wouldn’t necessarily put the brakes on anything in any way whatsoever. I think this is a Safari Doctors baby! Being here, being close to home, to be able to fill some of the gaps in accessing health care, it’s kind of been an IV drip for life and purpose. Want to get involved?

139,A Valentine for black men (Opinion),2015-02-14," (CNN) It has been a painful few years for young black men in America. From Florida to Ferguson to New York, our TV screens have delivered   images. It is a story centuries old of mothers and fathers crying out for their sons, wives for husbands, and neighbors for friends whose lives tragically ended too soon. Their grief has been amplified across race and culture as people of good conscious everywhere stood together to shout #BlackLivesMatter.  They say love can heal all wounds. So on this Valentine’s Day I’m sending a love letter to black men with a prayer that in the coming years the black community will do everything it can to promote healing and respect.   My Valentine message is simple: I love you. And, I ask that we stand strong with our fellow Americans to confront inequality and injustice in all  its forms. It will be necessary to look into our own hearts. We have to believe in our own  . Yes, we all have much work to do. But we’ve come so far    often only by faith    and we won many battles. We are up to the task.  The all too familiar statistics on black men are beyond distressing. Those numbers don’t bear repeating here. But listen to the stats long enough, over generations even, and they can become a   prophecy: Black men are dangerous they are to be feared, not valued.  Well, I refuse to be afraid, of my son, my neighbor, or every   stranger. Because while it may be true that numbers don’t lie, surely statistics can be skewed depending on whether your goal is to reach a positive or negative picture.   Jack McGoldrick, who is white, is not afraid either. He is challenging the statistics. Using   data from the U. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, U. S Departments of Education and Health and Human Services, McGoldrick decided to tell a different story    a positive story about black men in America.  The former Madison Avenue advertising executive and current head of his own marketing firm told me he has studied the   demographics for more than 20 years and always questioned why the positive statistics about young black men always got lost in the conversation. According to his data on black men 15 years and older: One out of three goes to college. Eleven out of 12 finishes high school. Five out of nine have jobs Three out of four are drug free. Seven out of eight are not teenage fathers.  McGoldrick wants to share these facts. So he recently teamed up with the local NAACP in Medford, Massachusetts, to produce a captivating YouTube video that features 20 black teenagers mostly from Medford High School. The video opens with three boys. One begins: ”I am a statistic, the one out of three that goes to college.” Eventually more boys join in and recite all the positive statistics. The video, titled ”Statistic,” has also popped up on twitter under the hashtag: #IAMASTATISTIC.  ”Young black men are doing positive things in the world and we just don’t talk about these stories,” said McCormick, who produced the video project pro bono for the NAACP. ”Ferguson, Trayvon Martin, Staten Island [Eric Garner] you hear so many horrible stories, we have little reason to think positive. But I want tell black men the truth. My hope for the future is that they can be proud and feel free to be themselves, not have to worry about color all the time.” Keith Taylor, a freshman engineering student at Drexel University in Philadelphia, told me he is not surprised by the positive stats for the most part, but a few did shock him into silence on the phone. He wondered why he’d never heard this information.   ”You hear so much on the news about black men and drugs or crime. I’ve never heard that three out of four young black men are drug free. And, I’m surprised to hear that most of us are not teenage fathers. The media pushes that images of us . .. and I bought into it.” Taylor grew up in Brooklyn, New York, and says he has seen his share of friends take the wrong path. But inspired by his parents    a mother who holds a master’s degree and a father who was in the Air Force    Taylor is setting his sights high. He’s doing his part to give back to his community and spends much of his spare time mentoring boys and girls, introducing them to engineering careers.  His hope for young black men is simple and wise, ”I wish that we would all come together and support one another. We can do a lot of great things and we just don’t know it. You have to lift your head up and see beyond what you see on TV.”   Whether it is the NAACP Statistics video, twitter tags that have gone viral in support of equality, or Beyoncé’s beautiful tribute to what she called the ”strength and vulnerability of black men” at the 2015 Grammy’s when she sang ”Precious Lord, Take My Hand,” it seems fitting this Black History Month to show some love for black men: Happy Valentine’s Day, my brothers.

140,What is a littoral combat ship?,2015-05-14," (CNN) The U. S. Navy on Wednesday said one of its newest warships, the littoral combat ship USS Fort Worth, had completed a weeklong patrol in the South China Sea. The Fort Worth was monitored closely by Chinese warships during the patrol, the Navy said. The South China Sea is the subject of numerous rival    often messy    territorial claims, with China, Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam disputing sovereignty of several island chains and nearby waters. China on Wednesday cautioned the U. S. against taking any actions that might be considered provocative, according to a report from the   Xinhua news service. Tensions in the South China Sea have increased in recent months as China has built facilities on five   sites in the Spratly Islands there, including a   ( ) airstrip. RELATED: China cautions U. S. Navy on patrols in South China Sea, James Hardy, editor of Jane’s Asia Pacific, told CNN in February that China was executing ”a methodical,   campaign to create a chain of   and   fortresses across the center of the Spratly Islands chain.” The U. S. Navy says the Fort Worth and other LCS vessels will be making more frequent visits to the region. ”Routine operations like the one Fort Worth just completed in the South China Sea will be the new normal as we welcome four LCSs to the region in the coming years. Deployment of multiple LCSs to Southeast Asia underscores the importance of this ’region on the rise’ and the value persistent presence brings,” Capt. Fred Kacher, commodore of the Navy’s Destroyer Squadron 7, said in a press release. The LCS, with a draft of between 14 and 15 feet and a speed of 40 knots, was designed to operate in the kind of environment that is reflected in its name, littorals, or shallower coastal areas. The USS Freedom, the first of the LCS vessels, was delivered to the Navy in 2008. Click through the gallery to learn more about the littoral combat ship."

142,You’d Be Surprised at How Many Foods Contain Added Sugar - The New York Times,2017-06-15,"You may know there’s added sugar in your Coke or cookies. But did you know that it’s in your salad dressing, pasta sauce and bread? The Food and Drug Administration came out Friday with its new template for nutrition labels. One big change was the addition of a line for “added sugar,” to be placed below a line for total sugar. The change is designed to distinguish between sugars that are naturally occurring in a food  —   like the milk sugar in a plain yogurt  —   and the sugars that food manufacturers include later to boost flavors  —   like the “evaporated cane juice” in a Chobani Kids strawberry yogurt. A team of researchers at the University of North Carolina conducted a detailed survey of the packaged foods and drinks that are purchased in American grocery stores and found that 60 percent of them include some form of added sugar. When they looked at every individual processed food in the store, 68 percent had added sugar. Some of those products are more obvious sugary foods, but not all. The list includes many sauces, soups, fruit juices and even meat products. You might think it’s easy to figure out whether the food manufacturer added sugar to your food, but it isn’t always so. While some foods include “sugar” in their ingredients, many use different words for products that are nutritionally similar. Most of us have heard of   corn syrup, a sugar made from processing corn. But there are also things like the “evaporated cane juice” in the yogurt, and “rice syrup” and “” which are less obvious and amount to the same thing. Barry Popkin, a professor of nutrition at the University of North Carolina, and one of the paper’s authors, said that the wide variety of sugars is not always meant to confound consumers. Instead, he said, the many sugar types are chosen by food scientists to give their products the best flavor and texture. Some sugars are better for baked goods, while others are better in soft drinks. Some are also cheaper than others. Sugar tariffs and import laws make it expensive to bring in too much foreign sugar. But not all of the sugar formulations count toward the laws’ quotas. There’s also the matter of fruit juice concentrates, which are juices that have been stripped of nearly everything but sugar and evaporated. A lot of seemingly natural foods include ingredients like “apple juice concentrate. ” That’s sugar. That will be a lot clearer when the labels are updated. “It’s going to really surprise people who go to organic and whole foods stores, when they find that all this natural food they’ve been buying is full of added sugar,” Mr. Popkin said. “It’s full of fruit juice concentrates, and they thought it was all good stuff. ” The emphasis on added sugar comes from new nutrition guidelines that urge Americans to consume a “healthy dietary pattern” containing certain types of foods. According to the regulation, hidden added sugars make it difficult to understand whether the food you are eating is part of that healthy pattern. Medical evidence shows that high sugar consumption is linked to obesity, diabetes and tooth decay  —   though not all of that work distinguishes between added sugar and total sugar. Many of the big food industry trade groups and lobbyists were satisfied with the new label rules, as my colleague Sabrina Tavernise recently wrote. But the sugar industry and the corn refiners are upset. Critics of the policy argue that the difference between natural and added sugars is not nutritionally meaningful, and that the science establishing health harms from added sugar is weak. The new label will kick in for large food companies in 2018, and for smaller companies a year later. The U. N. C. research used its master list of sugar code words to measure how many grocery store foods include sugar. But measuring the precise amount of sugars that are added with the current label is quite difficult. Mr. Popkin said consumers would be surprised by recent research from his team revealing the large amounts of added sugars in products that are generally thought of as healthy  —   foods like infant formula, protein bars and yogurt."
143,"3-year-old boy shoots father, pregnant mother",2015-02-01," (CNN) A    boy shot his father and pregnant mother over the weekend inside a hotel room in Albuquerque, New Mexico.  Police say the boy removed a handgun from his mother’s purse Saturday and fired one shot, striking his father in the lower backside.  The bullet apparently exited through the father’s hip and hit the mother in the right shoulder. She is eight months pregnant, said Officer Simon Drobik of the Albuquerque Police Department.  The father was treated and released from the hospital while the mother was hospitalized in stable condition. The condition of her unborn child is unknown.  The boy and his    sister, who was also in the hotel room, are under the care of the Children’s Youth and Families department. They were not injured in the incident.  Drobik says the case has been sent to Albuquerque District Attorney’s Office, which will determine whether the parents will be charged with criminal negligence.  Police did not identify the family.

144,"Oscar Pistorius Is Unfit to Testify at Sentencing, Psychologist Says - The New York Times",2016-06-14,"LONDON  —   Oscar Pistorius, the   Olympic runner who shot his girlfriend to death in 2013, is unfit to testify at his sentencing for murder, a defense psychologist said as a hearing opened on Monday in a court in Pretoria, South Africa. “Currently, in my opinion, he is not able to testify,” the psychologist, Jonathan Scholtz, told Judge Thokozile Matilda Masipa of the High Court in Pretoria, arguing that Mr. Pistorius should be hospitalized rather than imprisoned. “His condition is severe. ” Under questioning from Mr. Pistorius’s defense lawyer, Barry Roux, Dr. Scholtz gave a largely sympathetic account of Mr. Pistorius’s background, personality and mental health. Dr. Scholtz said Mr. Pistorius showed symptoms of depression, anxiety and   stress disorder. He also said Mr. Pistorius was taking psychiatric medication and had problems with   memory. Gerrie Nel, the chief prosecutor, rejected that argument, saying that Mr. Pistorius had not expressed remorse for the death of his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp. Mr. Nel also questioned Dr. Scholtz’s assertion that Mr. Pistorius was unable to testify, given that Mr. Pistorius recently gave an interview, his first about the killing, to the television network ITV. The interview is scheduled to be broadcast on June 24, which is probably after his sentencing. Guidelines call for a sentence of at least 15 years, but the judge has discretion to render a lighter or tougher sentence. The decision, which is not expected until later this week, will bring to a close a case that has riveted and divided South Africa. Mr. Pistorius, 29, was found guilty in December of murdering Ms. Steenkamp after South Africa’s top appeals court overturned a lower court’s conviction on the lesser charge of manslaughter. The court found that the earlier conviction had been based on a misinterpretation of laws and an erroneous dismissal of circumstantial evidence. The appeals court said Mr. Pistorius, who insists that he accidentally killed Ms. Steenkamp under the mistaken belief that an intruder had broken into his home, should have foreseen that his actions would kill someone. He fired four shots through a locked bathroom door, killing Ms. Steenkamp, who was on the other side. In a country with a high crime rate, the fear of home intrusion cuts across social and racial lines, and high walls and security guards are common in gated communities like the one where Mr. Pistorius lived in Pretoria. Mr. Pistorius’s arrest in the killing of Ms. Steenkamp on Feb. 14, 2013, sent South Africans reeling. Known as the Blade Runner for the flexible   prosthetic legs he used when competing, Mr. Pistorius achieved worldwide fame by challenging   athletes, most notably at the 2012 London Games. He won medals at the 2004, 2008 and 2012 Summer Paralympics. Ms. Steenkamp, who was 29 at the time of her death, was a model, a law school graduate and a budding   star. In September 2014  —   after a lengthy and highly publicized trial that was likened to the   trial of O. J. Simpson in the United States  —   Judge Masipa convicted Mr. Pistorius of culpable homicide but found him not guilty of murder. She found that prosecutors had failed to present “strong circumstantial evidence” and to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Pistorius had shown intent to kill. Prosecutors, and Ms. Steenkamp’s family, argued that Mr. Pistorius had deliberately killed his girlfriend after an argument. Although Mr. Pistorius was regarded as a hero to many in South Africa, the trial revealed another, darker side: a man with a mercurial temper, given to jealousy and occasional anger an aggressive driver an irresponsible gun owner and a celebrity who was used to getting his way. In their appeal, prosecutors argued that Judge Masipa had misinterpreted a crucial legal concept in finding Mr. Pistorius not guilty of murder. They argued that, under a legal principle known as dolus eventualis, Mr. Pistorius should be found guilty because he should have known that firing through the locked door would kill the person inside. The Supreme Court of Appeal, in Bloemfontein, agreed. Mr. Pistorius was released from prison in October after serving one year of the   sentence for manslaughter, and he has been living under house arrest. Dr. Scholtz called Mr. Pistorius’s relationship with Ms. Steenkamp “a normal, loving relationship,” with “no signs of abuse or coercion. ” Dr. Scholtz said that Mr. Pistorius “has found some solace in the belief that the deceased is with God,” and that he was enrolled in a degree program at the University of London. He argued that further incarceration “would not be psychologically or socially constructive” and that Mr. Pistorius was not a threat to society. Mr. Pistorius, once a gun enthusiast, has sold his firearms, Dr. Scholtz said. “He is adamant that he never wants to touch or handle a firearm again,” the psychiatrist said. But Mr. Nel, who   Dr. Scholtz, suggested that Mr. Pistorius had not expressed remorse. “Does he understand that he committed murder?” Mr. Nel asked. “Yes,” Dr. Scholtz said. “In what way?” Mr. Nel asked. The prosecutor then made it clear that he was unconvinced."
145,What Donald Trump Got Wrong on Stop-and-Frisk - The New York Times,2016-09-29,"Among the senseless beatings inflicted on reality during the presidential debate on Monday night was the discussion of New York City’s    tactics. Donald J. Trump attributed a nonexistent increase in murder to actions that never happened, namely, the ending of the    practice by, variously, “a judge, who was a very   judge,” and the “current mayor. ” This was multilayered fiction. Murder declined. A judge did not end   . Neither did the current mayor. In fact, the Police Department began to drastically curtail its use in 2012, under the administration of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, an independent. This is well documented but only lightly noticed. On July 9, 2012, an editorial in The New York Post warned that the reduction in its use would lead to “more blood in the street. ” By the way, did more blood run in the street? No, less blood did. Murder is down 32 percent since 2011, the last year of the old    era, having dropped to 352 homicides in 2015 from 515 in 2011. In the same period, stops were down by about 97 percent, said J. Peter Donald, a spokesman for the department. During the debate, Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee, alluded to a few of these numbers. Mr. Trump, her Republican opponent, started shouting. “Under the current mayor, crime has continued to drop, including murders,” she said. “So there is  —   —  ” “No, you’re wrong,” Mr. Trump interjected. “You’re wrong. ” “No, I’m not,” Mrs. Clinton said. “Murders are up, all right,” Mr. Trump said. “You check it. ” All right, as Mr. Trump said, let’s check it. A Google search for “Historical New York City Crime Data” will bring you to a site with charts of serious felonies. Frisks went down. So has murder, a steady decline that has continued, with slight annual variations, through this year. In the     used by Mr. Trump, those details land upside down. Also, he repeated a more common mistake about the decline of the    tactics, attributing it to a federal judge hearing a   lawsuit against the city, and to Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat, who succeeded Mr. Bloomberg in 2014. “It was terminated by the current mayor,” Mr. Trump said. Actually, no. Last year, the city police conducted 22, 939 stops, or about 63 a day. So    was not terminated by Mr. de Blasio, or by anyone else for that matter. It’s true that the use of the tactic has declined. During the mayoralty of Mr. Bloomberg, the number of reported stops skyrocketed, but then was scaled back as the city faced pressure from the   litigation, brought by the New York Civil Liberties Union and the Center for Constitutional Rights. By the end of 2013, the year Shira A. Scheindlin, the federal judge hearing the case, ruled that the city’s wholesale search practices violated the Constitution, the number of stops had declined by 72 percent from its peak in 2011. “But    had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City,” Mr. Trump said during the debate. “Tremendous beyond belief. So when you say it has no impact, it really did. It had a very, very big impact. ” During the era praised by Mr. Trump, about 90 percent of the people who were stopped were young black or Latino men who had committed no crime whatsoever, according to police data. Of those few who were arrested, the vast majority were charged with nothing more serious than possession of marijuana, not having guns. Hundreds of thousands of innocent people were being stopped every year so that the city could arrest tens of thousands for having weed. Applied almost exclusively to minorities, the    tactics in New York became an elephantine government project that wasted time and money, degrading both to the personhood of the men and women who were stopped and to the professionalism of the people doing the stopping. It was poor social hygiene, not defensible as a matter of law or as effective law and order. As Mr. Trump said, it was “tremendous beyond belief. ” Just so."

Upon further review, it turned out the man who police believed was stoned on marijuana, was actually bitten by his dog. [Rumors began circulating in the town of Groesbeck, Texas, after an emergency call reported shots had been fired in an area mobile home park, Groesbeck Police Chief Chris Henson posted on Facebook. Officer Cox was the first on the scene and discovered a man claiming to have been shot in the buttocks.  Seeking to stop the rumors, the Groesbeck police chief went to social media and posted, “During the course of the investigation, it was determined that the ‘victim’ had been smoking marijuana on the porch as the thunderstorm passed through the area. The loud thunder scared one of the dogs causing it to nip the ‘victim’ in the left buttock. He believed he’d been shot and subsequently called the police. He was treated at the scene by EMS and released. ” Members of the public were quick to respond to the chief’s posting. Paula M.

147,Iranian Newspapers Celebrate American Sailors’ Capture,2016-01-14,"Several Iranian newspapers published on Thursday featured lead stories on the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps’(IRGC) recent seizure of two U. S. boats and a ten sailor crew. [On Tuesday, just prior to President Obama’s State of the Union Address, ten U. S. naval sailors and their boats were detained by Iran’s navy while the two vessels navigated the Persian Gulf. Iran claimed the boats had entered Tehran’s territorial waters. The nine man, one woman crew was freed Wednesday afternoon, but not before Iranian media utilized the sailors for propaganda value, taping video interviews with the service members in violation of the Geneva Conventions.  According to translations by Iran Front Page, and the graphics displayed on the front page of several   newspapers, the papers highlighted Iran’s arrest of the U. S. sailors. The lead story of Aftab reads: “US thanks Iran [for swiftly freeing American marines]” A story on the cover of Ebtekar, which has been described as a reformist paper, says “US sailors freed, received respectful treatment,” according to the Iran Front Page translation.  The cover of Iran’s Etemad newspaper displays several photos of the U. S. sailors, including the moments showcasing their arrest.  Hemayat news also features the moment the U. S. sailors surrender to Iran’s navy.  “Iran” news, which is published by the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) also features photos of the sailors’ surrender, sporting the headline: “Iran’s seizure of 10 US navy sailors from beginning to end. ” The Jamejan newspaper features as the lead story: “US apology  …     US marines freed by Iran. ” Javan news headlines the President’s State of The Union and how the “US marines apologized” and then “won” their freedom.

148,BAFTA to Block Awards For Films That Aren’t Diverse Enough,2016-12-16,"Two of the main British Film Academy of Film and Television Arts (Bafta) awards will only be awarded to films which meet diversity targets, the British Film Institute (BFI) has announced. [From 2019 onwards, nominations for the awards of ‘outstanding British film’ and ‘outstanding debut by a British writer, director or producer’ will need to conform to the BFI’s Diversity Standards, established two years ago to increase representation of minorities within British film.  The nominations will have to show that they have improved diversity within at least two of four categories to qualify:   characters and themes senior roles and crew industry training and career progression and audience access and appeal to   audiences, the BBC has reported. In a statement, Bafta said they believed the changes constituted “a flexible and achievable model, which the whole industry can adopt as a shared language for understanding diversity. ” To be able to qualify for award nomination,   will have to demonstrate they have “worked to increase the representation of   groups” in areas including “onscreen representation” and “industry access and opportunities”. It means popular films such as the James Bond hit Skyfall, which won two Baftas including ‘Best British film’ in 2012, would have likely missed out on that award as it would be unlikely to meet the diversity criteria. The film also won two Oscars and two Grammys. Simon Albury, the chairman of the Campaign for Broadcasting Equality, said the new rules were “a very positive move” as black and ethnic minorities are   on screen at the moment. But Conservative MP Philip Davies, an outspoken critic of feminism and political correctness, said that the move would only appeal to “luvvies” in the film industry. “I am sure that this new criteria will be welcomed by the politically correct,    privileged film industry luvvies who will be patting themselves on the back for being trendy and right on,” he said. “In the real world the vast majority of people believe in merit and want awards to go to the best films rather than the most   films. ”"

She’s inside ambulances, hospitals  …    ” joked Milo, as the audience burst into laughter. “You know they said it was a vast   conspiracy. They said you can’t talk about it. ‘It’s sexism and ageism to talk about Hillary’s health, and then  …    ” Milo mockingly collapsed to the floor as the podium rattled and the laughter in the audience grew louder. “Every day, when the Hillary campaign wakes up.

Who cares? ’” During his speech at the Millenials for Trump rally in Georgia, Milo also praised the high turnout of young people who wouldn’t usually be so enthused by a Republican presidential candidate. He also praised America as the greatest country in the world, before warning the audience about the dangers of Islam and political correctness that have already plagued countries in Europe. Milo was preceded by Quaterrius Manuel, a black Republican teenager who was mercilessly harassed by Black Lives Matter activists after he appeared in a viral video where he debated a black Democrat on Donald Trump. Manuel asked the audience whether they wanted their country back, before proclaiming “enough is enough” and encouraging millennials in the audience to vote for Donald Trump. National   and   of Students for Trump, John Lambert, followed Manuel and listed various things that both Trump and Clinton had done, before asking the audience whether they thought it sounded like a candidate who should go to the White House or jail. “I’m going to say a description of a candidate and I want you to say whether they belong in the White House, or if they belong in jail” said Lambert, before describing the controversies surround Clinton’s emails, the amount of jobs Trump has created, and Clinton’s cozyness with foreign dictators. The audience chanted “jail” for each description of Clinton. Senator Michael Williams also spoke before Milo, where he encouraged the audience to “make your voices heard through every means available. ” Watch Milo’s full speech below: Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.

152,Thailand: Crown prince assumes throne as King Rama X,2016-12-01," (CNN) After 49 days of uncertainty, Thailand has a new King.  Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn, 64, officially accepted an invitation by the Thai government on Thursday to assume the throne. The new Rama X will be known as King Maha Vajiralongkorn Bodindradebayavarangkun. The Chakri dynasty, beginning with Rama I, has ruled Thailand since 1782.  Following the October death of his father, King Bhumibol Adulyadej, Vajiralongkorn said he needed ”time to mourn” before he took the crown.  A temporary regent ruled Thailand during this period of constitutional uncertainty.  Crown prince since 1972, Born in July 1952, Vajiralongkorn was first introduced to the Thai people through his father’s home videos, which were shown in theaters across the country.  He was educated in the United Kingdom and Australia before officially being declared crown prince and heir apparent in 1972.  His older sister, Princess Ubolratana Rajakanya, who is 65, could not ascend to the throne since women are not allowed to become monarch under Thailand’s succession laws.  Vajiralongkorn has been married three times    to Soamsawali Kitiyakara in 1977, Yuvadhida Polpraserth in 1994 and Srirasmi Suwadee in 2001    and has two daughters and five sons, only one of whom is officially recognized as a prince.  Uncharted path, King Bhumibol ruled Thailand for seven decades, a time in which the country underwent massive change and turmoil, including war and more than a dozen coups (both attempted and successful).  Bhumibol was seen as a unifying figure, beloved by most Thais and regarded as above politics.  As the king’s health faded during his last years, instability and chaos dominated the country. Popularly elected Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra was overthrown in a military coup in 2006, and another one followed in 2014. Since then, the military junta has passed two constitutions shoring up its power and weakening its rivals.  Some observers put the tensions down to uncertainty over the looming succession. Bhumibol was seen as a vital source of political legitimacy for all sides, and he will be a tough act to follow.  Reporting on the succession or the royal family is limited by strict   laws, which impose harsh sentences on anyone who defames or insults the King or senior royals. "
153,Obama spends final press conference of 2016 warning Putin and Russia: ’We can do stuff to you’,2016-12-17,"’  ’ ’   President Barack Obama hit at Russia and President Vladimir Putin   during his final     press conference. ’ ’   Obama stopped short of blaming Putin directly for hacks that   interfered with the US presidential election, but he still   pointed his finger in that direction. ’ ’   ”The intelligence that I’’ve seen gives me great confidence in   their assessment that the Russians carried out this hack,” he   said. ’ ”   Questions surrounding Russian interference in the election have   become a central focus in recent days amid  concluded   Russia interfered in the US election with the specific goal of   aiding Trump’s campaign. It was  that the FBI supported the   CIA’s findings. ” ”   Internal emails from members of the Democratic National Committee   and John Podesta, the chairman of Hillary Clinton’s campaign,   were leaked online throughout the campaign. The organization   WikiLeaks released a steady stream of Podesta’s emails in the   final weeks of the campaign. ” ’   Intelligence officials  that Putin himself was directly involved   in the hacks. And Obama seems to share that opinion, even if he   neglected to fully endorse it. ’ ’   ”Not much happens in Russia without Vladimir Putin,” Obama said.   ”This is pretty hierarchical operation. Last I checked, there’’s   not a lot of debate and democratic deliberation, particularly   when it comes to policies directed at the United States.” ’ ’   Obama also warned against allowing Russia to influence American   political culture. ’ ’   ”The Russians can’’t change us or significantly weaken us,” he   said. ”They are a smaller country. They are a weaker country.   Their economy doesn’’t produce anything that anybody wants to buy   except oil and gas and arms. They don’’t innovate. But they can   impact us if we lose track of who we are.” ’ ’   He also chided Republicans who support Putin. ’ ’   ”There was a survey that some of you saw where  —   now this is just   one poll, but a pretty credible source  —   that 37% of Republican   voters approve of Putin,” Obama said. ”Over a third of Republican   voters approve of Vladimir Putin, the former head of the KGB.   Ronald Reagan would roll over in his grave.” ’ ’   Trump was often criticized during the election for his apparent   fondness for Putin. Trump has often said that he would like the   US to have a closer and more cooperative relationship with   Russia. ’ ’   But many in the foreign policy community see Russia as an   adversary, especially considering the recent hacks. ’ ’  ’ ’   Obama detailed some of the US efforts to stop Russian hacking in   the future. ’ ’   ”What we can also do is to, on a bilateral basis, warn other   countries against these kinds of attacks,” Obama said. ”And we’’ve   done that in the past. So just as I told Russia to stop it and   indicated that there will be consequences when they do it, the   Chinese have in the past engaged in cyberattacks directed at our   companies to steal trade secrets and proprietary technology. . ..   What we’’ve seen is some evidence that they have reduced, but not   completely eliminated, these activities.” ’ ”   He also emphasized that not all of these efforts to deter   Russia’s cyberattacks are public. ” ’   ”Our goal continues to be to send a clear message to Russia or   others not to do this to us, because we can do stuff to you,”   Obama said. ”But it is also important for us to do that in a   thoughtful, methodical way. Some of it we do publicly. Some of it   we will do in a way that they know but not everybody will.” ’ ’   He continued: ”And I know that there have been folks out there   who suggest somehow that if we went out there and made big   announcements and thumped our chests about a bunch of stuff, that   somehow that would potentially spook the Russians, but keep in   mind that we already have enormous numbers of sanctions against   the Russians.” ’ ’   Obama also said that the ”idea that somehow public shaming is   going to be effective” in preventing future hacking ”doesn’’t read   the thought process in Russia very well.” ’ ’   Obama also reassured the public that while Russia might have   attempted to interfere with the US election, the voting process   was still sound. ’ ’   ”I can assure the public that there was not the kind of tampering   with the voting process that was a concern and will continue to   be a concern going forward, that the votes that were cast were   counted  —   they were counted appropriately. We have not seen   evidence of machines being tampered with,” Obama said. ’ ’   ”That doesn’’t mean that we find every single potential probe of   every single voting machine all across the country, but we paid a   lot of attention to it . .. and we feel confident that that didn’’t   occur.” ’"

155,ATP Finals: Resilient Murray wears down Wawrinka,2016-11-18,"London (CNN) After not facing a   player since June, world No. 1 Andy Murray has beaten two within three days at the ATP World Tour Finals.  The British tennis star followed up Wednesday’s   battle with Japan’s Kei Nishikori by sealing a semifinal place with a more straightforward     victory over   Stan Wawrinka. It gave Murray a   record in his group, and sets up the possibility of a   No. 1 showdown with Novak Djokovic if both win on Saturday. Wawrinka, however, exited the   tournament after suffering his second   defeat. The Swiss player had won three of their past four meetings, but his inconsistency meant he couldn’t match Murray’s mental fortitude in a match lasting less than 90 minutes    not even half the time the Scot spent on court against Nishikori. However, the scoreline doesn’t tell the whole story. Wawrinka typically saves his best for the big occasion    the    is   vs. world No. 1s in grand slam finals and   otherwise. Often maligned for blowing hot and cold, Wawrinka opened proceedings with a succession of ripping winners    the first a trademark backhand down the line    to put Murray on the back foot.  If the ”Stanimal” was silenced by Nishikori earlier this week, he was now out of his cage.   ”I think I weathered the early storm a little bit,” Murray admitted after the match. ”Stan came out hitting a lot of winners, a lot of aces.” The sellout home crowd could have been forgiven for shifting awkwardly in their seats. Wawrinka had cut a disconsolate figure even before Monday’s defeat was wrapped up here he was quite the opposite, taking risks, pumping fists and generally playing with a far greater sense of urgency.  Murray, after all, only had to win a set to guarantee his own path to the last four, while Wawrinka    who had just one victory, against Marin Cilic    needed every point he could get to have a chance of progressing to the semis for the fourth year in a row.  But despite the complex qualification permutations, Murray didn’t once take his foot off the gas. ”Once I got through the early part of the match, I started to create chances in most of his service games,” said Murray. ”I served very well myself, [and] got a lot of free points on my serve.”  Wawrinka also attributed Murray’s success to his consistency. ”Murray was serving really well. He didn’t give me even a chance, and made me hesitate a bit with my game  —   when to go and when to stay back.”  ”That’s why he’s so good that’s why he’s no. 1.” Even after the longest   match in the tournament’s history, ice baths and just a single day’s rest, Murray had the sheer guts to gradually wear down his opponent. And, having taken the first set with one of his first   opportunities, Murray came out of the blocks quickly at the restart to break his opponent again.   Wawrinka’s urgency turned to anger and desperation.  When Murray broke again to open up a   lead, his opponent snapped    taking his frustrations out on his racket    joking after the match ”if I’m going to break it, I’ll do it properly.” Wawrinka may have caught the eye, hitting 29 winners to 15, but Murray won the points that mattered and made just 13 unforced errors to 27.  He will next face Canadian fourth seed Milos Raonic in a rematch of July’s Wimbledon final, where Murray claimed his third grand slam title. Who will end the year as No. 1? Have your say on our Facebook page, Djokovic, who can reclaim the No. 1 ranking by winning the tournament for the fifth successive year, will play fifth seed Nishikori in his semifinal after topping his group with three wins. Visit cnn.  for more news and videos, Nishikori progressed to the last four for the first time, having won more sets than Wawrinka ahead of his final group match against Croatia’s Cilic in Friday’s evening session. Cilic downed Nishikori       in a repeat of the 2014 US Open final also won by the former. "
156,’NO WAY!’: Trump fires back after Obama says he would’ve won if he ran,2016-12-27,"’  ’ ’   After President Barack Obama said in an interview with former   senior adviser David Axelrod that he thinks he would have won if   he had run this year,   Donald Trump fired   back on Twitter with a clear conviction of his own. ’ ’   ”NO WAY!” Trump tweeted. ’ ’   In Obama’’s interview, which aired on CNN’’s ”” podcast Monday, the president acknowledged he was   acting a bit like a ”Monday morning quarterback,” analyzing the   election after it played out.

157,"California Today: A ‘See Something, Say Something’ Prostitution Plan - The New York Times",2016-09-16,"Good morning. Welcome to California Today, a morning update on the stories that matter to Californians (and anyone else interested in the state). Tell us about the issues that matter to you  —   and what you’d like to see: CAtoday@nytimes. com. Want to receive California Today by email? Sign up. Thomas Fuller, the  San Francisco bureau chief for The New York Times, provides today’s introduction with news of an unusual   initiative in the Bay Area. Oakland hosts millions of visitors every year for its sports events, thriving restaurant scene and growing technology businesses. The city also gets lots of    johns who prowl the streets for sex. Of the 660 arrests made last year for prostitution in Oakland, more than   of the suspects came from outside the city. On Saturday, Oakland is taking an unconventional step in fighting its image as one of America’s most   cities, introducing a website, reportjohn. org, that city authorities hope will deter customers of the sex trade. Residents will be encouraged to note down the license plate numbers of suspected johns’ vehicles and describe the specific activity they witnessed. The sightings are uploaded to the police, who will send a letter to the address where the vehicle is registered. Karely Ordaz Salto, the chairwoman of the city’s Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children Task Force, says Oakland is the first city to target johns in this way. “The hope is that they will think twice and this will deter them,” said Lt. Jill Encinias of the Oakland Police Department. “We really need to attack this problem from all sides. We need to start focusing on the demand. ” The first question in the online form gets straight to the point: “Do you have any photos of the activity?” The city’s problem with prostitution, and especially the involvement of girls, has been underscored this year by a scandal in its police department involving a young prostitute who claimed that she had had sex with officers and said the police had tipped her off to raids. The scandal led to the departure of three police chiefs in less than two weeks. The predecessor to reportjohn. org was a program called Dear John, introduced in 2013, which allowed residents to fill out a form that they submitted to the police. That program generated more than 300 “Dear John” letters mailed to the owners of the vehicles spotted by residents. The police department considered it such a success that the authorities wanted to move it to an online format. Although the program could conceivably lead to foul play  —   vendettas by jilted lovers or disgruntled neighbors come to mind  —   Lieutenant Encinias said there had been no signs of false reporting in the Dear John program. That said, stay tuned for reaction from civil liberties groups. “This has historically been something that people thought they could do in the shadows,” said Erica Terry Derryck, a spokeswoman for Mayor Libby Schaaf. “The intent is to put people on notice. ” • No, the federal government does not have plans to kill 45, 000 wild horses in the western United States.

That’s the idea behind two new   crosswalk designs in downtown Santa Monica. The city hired two artists, armed with buckets of boldly colored paints, to create the artworks this week as part of an effort to delight pedestrians, said Constance Farrell, a city spokeswoman. The Federal Highway Administration actually frowns on crosswalk art, calling them distracting. But that hasn’t stopped a bunch of municipalities from doing it, anyway. Long Beach, West Hollywood and San Francisco are among the cities that have colored their crosswalks in recent years, though perhaps not quite on so grand a scale as Santa Monica. One of the designs fills the entire intersection at one of the city’s 12 new “scramble crosswalks”  —   the kind that lets you cross the street every which way, including diagonally. Counter to the government’s recommendations, Ms. Farrell suggested that the bright colors would improve safety by catching drivers’ attention. One has to wonder, though, how long the sheen will hold up under an unending march of vehicle tires and footsteps. “Upkeep is something we’re monitoring,” Ms. Farrell said.

158,Asia Pivot: Obama Hosts Southeast Asian Leaders in SoCal - Breitbart,2016-02-15,"On Monday, President Barack Obama hosted members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) for the start of a   summit at the scenic Sunnylands retreat in Rancho Mirage. [Their agenda includes counterterrorism, maritime security and regional and economic trade issues. The summit is the first of its kind, and is largely seen as a a means of developing a strategy to counter China’s hegemonic growth in the region.  “The White House sees Sunnylands as very special treatment   …     where the president of the United States is leaving Washington and he’s going to spend two full days exclusively focused on these leaders and these individuals,” Murray Hiebert, who studies Southeast Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told the Associated Press. Leaders from Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Brunei, Laos and Myanmar will be in attendance to represent the organization they helped create in 1967. The AP notes that while many of the ASEAN leaders would have preferred to have been invited to the White House, since they have never visited Washington, “the range of political systems  —   from open democracy to   rule  —   and the checkered human rights records among member countries” makes the Sunnylands the optimal destination for the summit as it places a distance between those nations and the democratic values the White House represents. For Obama, the Sunnylands is his version of a “Western White House,” and the equivalent of President George W. Bush’s Texas ranch, where the 43rd commander in chief would host world leaders and foreign counterparts in a more comfortable, casual setting. He met with King Abdullah II of Jordan —  a key U. S. ally in the turbulent Middle East —  at Sunnylands in February of 2014 and with Chinese President Xi Jinping in June of 2013. China will not be represented at the summit as it is not an ASEAN member. Obama will likely use the meeting to deepen U. S. relations with Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam three strategic U. S. allies in the region and as an extension of his administration’s 2012 “Pivot to Asia” regional strategy. As China’s emergence as a regional hegemonic power continues, it has been suggested that the country perceives the strategic diplomatic ties the U. S. has developed with nations located near its borders as part of an alleged “China containment policy. ” Growing tensions in the South China Sea have prompted a greater U. S. presence in the region, including the deployment of a U. S. spy plane off the island of Singapore in December. The AP notes that the late Walter and Leonore Annenberg, who built Sunnylands, had hoped the   property would become the “Camp David of the West. ” One of the big draws for the president, an avid golfer, is the retreat’s lush, beautiful golfing range.

159,BOOKLASH: The Celebrities Mad About MILO’s Book Deal - Breitbart,2016-12-31,"The announcement, coverage, and consequential bestselling position on Amazon for Breitbart Senior Editor MILO’s upcoming book Dangerous has triggered all the right people —   particularly Hollywood’s elitist class. [Sarah Silverman,  “The guy has freedom of speech but to fund him  give him a platform tells me a LOT about @simonschuster” proclaimed Silverman on Twitter. “YUCK AND BOO AND GROSS. ” The guy has freedom of speech but to fund him  give him a platform tells me a LOT about @simonschuster YUCK AND BOO AND GROSS https:  .   —   Sarah Silverman (@SarahKSilverman) December 29, 2016,  Judd Apatow, Responding to a call for people to boycott Dangerous publisher Simon and Schuster, The 40 Year Old Virgin and Trainwreck director Judd Apatow declared: “I am in!

Shame on @simonschuster ! https:  .   —   Judd Apatow (@JuddApatow) December 30, 2016,  Howard Dean, Former Governor of Vermont Howard Dean attacked Simon and Schuster after learning of MILO’s book deal, citing the libelous claims made by Think Progress that MILO is a “white supremacist. ” “This is an embarrassment for S and S and their owner CBS which is already on record putting their company ahead of the USA” wrote Dean, warranting replies from users hoping for “financial failure,” seemingly unaware that MILO’s book reached number one on Amazon’s bestseller list. This is an embarrassment for S and S and their owner CBS which is already on record putting their company ahead of the USA. https:  .   —   Howard Dean (@GovHowardDean) December 30, 2016,  Perez Hilton, Celebrity gossip blogger Perez Hilton described MILO as a “walking sack of maggots” following the announcement of his book, also opting to file the story under “icky icky poo. ” “Disgusting doesn’t even begin to describe this situation!” proclaimed Hilton in a blog post about MILO’s upcoming book Dangerous, before falsely claiming that MILO sent “racist epithets” to Leslie Jones. “Yuck, what a disappointing situation” Hilton concluded. “So, will YOU be boycotting the publishing house?” Commenters were quick to point out that MILO is just the modern day version of Hilton, who used to be a figure of controversy before dying out. “He is not diferent than you, Perez,” declared one user, while another added, “He’s doing exactly [what] you [did when you] became famous for a decade ago. ” One user also declared, “Milo is the voice of the New Gay Generation,” a dig at Hilton who is gay himself. Joy Reid, MSNBC correspondent and   author Joy Reid claimed that “We have entered a truly hideous age,” after hearing the announcement of MILO’s book. We have entered a truly hideous age. https:  .   —   Joy Reid (@JoyAnnReid) December 29, 2016,  Reid, however, is the same person who blindly took Shaun King’s word that his father is black, disregarding and condemning MILO’s investigation into both parents listed on King’s birth certificate being white while live on television, despite not having any evidence to back up King’s claims.   On Thursday, Red Alert Politics predicted that MILO’s book would quickly sell more copies than Hillary Clinton’s Stronger Together, which sold less than 3, 000 copies in its first week. “Progressives are uncomfortable that the ideology they reject is becoming more mainstream and a larger segment of American life. They’d be much happier if publishing companies spent money giving liberal politicians and activists big advances for books that nobody reads or buys like Hillary Clinton’s Stronger Together (sold less than 3, 000 copies its first week),” wrote Red Alert. “The best liberal freakouts are yet to come, wait until Yiannopoulos sells more copies of Dangerous than Clinton did of Stronger Together. ” Following Red Alert’s prediction, MILO’s book rose quickly through Amazon’s charts, becoming the number one bestselling book on the site just one day after being announced and over two months before its release. “Milo” became the number one trending topic on Twitter in the U. S. on Thursday, following MILO’s announcement of the book, with its publisher Simon and Schuster reaching the third most trending topic. Since the announcement of Dangerous by MILO, The Chicago Review of Books have also announced that they would boycott every book from publisher Simon and Schuster in 2017 as a protest against the book being published. “They said banning me from Twitter would finish me off. Just as I predicted, the opposite has happened,” said MILO in a comment to the Hollywood Reporter about his book. “Did it hurt Madonna being banned from MTV in the 1990s? Did all that negative press hurt Donald Trump’s chances of winning the election?” “I met with top execs at Simon  Schuster earlier in the year and spent half an hour trying to shock them with lewd jokes and outrageous opinions,” he continued. “I thought they were going to have me escorted from the building  —   but instead they offered me a wheelbarrow full of money. ” “Every line of attack the forces of political correctness try on me fails pathetically,” MILO concluded. “I’m more powerful, more influential, and more fabulous than ever before and this book is the moment Milo goes mainstream. Social justice warriors should be scared  —   very scared. ” DANGEROUS is available to   now via Amazon, in hardcover and Kindle editions. And yes, MILO is reading the audiobook version himself!

She then asked, “The films that are being made  —   are the   producers thinking outside of the box in terms of how to cast the role?” Davis, who was nominated for an Oscar in 2011 (The Help) and 2008 (Doubt) said that producers should ask themselves during the casting process, “Can you cast a black woman in that role? Can you cast a black man in that role?” “The problem isn’t even our pay,” she told ET. “You could probably line up all the   Black actresses out there [and] they probably don’t make what one   white woman makes in one film. That’s the problem. You can change the Academy, but if there are no black films being produced, what is there to vote for?” The actress, who said she’ll be going on vacation during this year’s Oscars, was asked about   Tyrese Gibson’s plea to Chris Rock to step down as this year’s Oscars host. “Like I said, the Oscars are not really the issue,” Davis said. “It’s a symptom of a much greater disease. But if he does, I hope he takes it as an opportunity to make a statement, a social statement about change. It’s 2016. ” Davis became the first woman of color to win an Emmy for Outstanding Actress in a drama series for her role in ABC’s How to Get Away with Murder last fall. For the second consecutive year, all 20 Oscar nominations in the four major acting categories have gone exclusively to white actors. As a result, a growing number of prominent Hollywood entertainers have weighed in on the renewed controversy, and some are pledging to boycott. The 88th Academy Awards will air live on Feb. 28 on ABC."
163,Pastor’s poem on racial injustice goes viral,2016-07-13," (CNN) As protests and violence spread throughout the nation in the past week, one pastor from Tampa felt she couldn’t stay silent anymore. Savanna Hartman wrote a poem about race and privilege and uploaded a video of her reciting it to Facebook, where it has now been viewed more than 17 million times. Speaking to CNN’s John Berman, she said, ”You can only let injustice go on for so long before you say something and I think a lot of us struggle with that bystander effect. . .. Finally I got to the point where I was just like, I can’t not say anything anymore.” In her poem, Hartman is in tears as she says, ”I wasn’t born rich, but don’t get it twisted. See how I look, my white skin is my privilege.” She refers to the shooting of Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge:  ”I don’t know what it’s like to go out for snacks and end up lying dead on my back . .. I don’t know anyone murdered for selling cigs or CDs, I’ve never been choked out or shot at by men in corrupt PDs.” Hartman felt moved to write her poem because, ”I think, deep down, no matter how we were raised, we all want the same thing and we all understand the value of a human life.” While the response to her poem has been largely positive, she and her husband have received accusations of being ”” an assertion she vehemently denied. ”That’s absolutely not the case. We love cops, we have people in our family who are cops, we support cops . .. we both think we can love cops but still address a broken system, and that’s what we did.” In her live CNN interview, Hartman emphasized the core of her message and called for more humanity on all sides. ”It shouldn’t be an issue of, you know, because you’re black, this is how you need to act around a cop. I think it should be, because you’re a human, we want to honor and respect other humans. And so we’re going to walk in honor and integrity and we’re going to respect authority. We’re gonna be loving. We’re gonna value human life.”"
164,Trump: ’A Lot of Democrats Are Going to Cross Over to Me’ - Breitbart,2016-01-31,"Sunday on CBS’s “Face the Nation,” Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump argued a lot of Democrats would cross over to support him in a general election.  Trump said, “I think I will appeal to them. One thing, we sort of agree on his trade, we are getting horribly beaten in trade the difference is I will make great trade deals he is not capable of doing it, he is incapable of doing it and, you know, he just won’t be able to do that. But he does at least acknowledge we are getting just absolutely ripped by China and all of these other countries. So in that way we are with the same. I think a lot of his people will come over. A one of the reasons that Iowa and I think the other guys won’t win I will get states they never will get, I have a chance of getting New York as an example and a good chance of getting Virginia. I will get Pennsylvania. I will get Ohio. I will get Michigan. I will get Florida, you know, my numbers just came down, I am at 48, the sitting senator I think is at 11 or 12, and a former governor is in the eights. But I think I will win Florida, and I win a lot of states. And one of the reasons I win them, a lot of Democrats are going to cross over to me because they are tired of what is happening.

165,No Moral Equivalence Between the Tea Party and the ’Resistance’,2017-02-08,"Mainstream media journalists have begun to justify the militancy, and violence, of the Democrats’   “resistance” by referring to the Tea Party’s protests at town hall meetings and elsewhere in  . [But there is no parallel and no moral equivalence between a nonpartisan   opposition movement that wanted to broaden public debate, and a   “community organizer” campaign that rejects normal politics, aims to disrupt public debate and stifle free speech.  As I documented in my book Wacko Birds: The Fall (and Rise) of the Tea Party, the movement had its roots in opposition to President George W. Bush’s bailout of Wall Street, emerged in the wake of President Barack Obama’s disastrous “stimulus,” and became a potent political movement in opposition to Obamacare. President Obama had wanted his health care bill passed by the late summer of 2009, and sent Democratic members of Congress to their districts to explain a bill they had not read. To many Americans, this was the third in a series of major pieces of legislation that was being forced down their throats with no real debate. They arrived at town hall meetings to ask questions  —   and, yes, to protest. But the real disruption was on the other side, as Democrats organized activists to stifle public opposition. At one town hall in suburban Chicago, for example,   activists conspired to block members of the public from asking questions  —   and were caught   on video.  To the extent there was violence at the town hall meetings, it was almost always carried out against Tea Party members. Meanwhile, the mainstream media vilified the Tea Party, playing up Democrats’ accusations that it was a racist organization. The worst of many examples of media misinformation was the false accusation that protesters at an   rally on Capitol Hill had used the “ ” against members of the Congressional Black Caucus  —   a claim for which no evidence was ever found. Since the midterm sweep of 2010, Democrats have been looking for their own Tea Party  —   and the media have been eager to help, doting on the new “movements” with generous media coverage while covering up their violence and extremist rhetoric. First there was Occupy Wall Street in 2011, then Black Lives Matter in   and now the “Resistance”  —   a name hinting at the Hunger Games and ultimately at the Second World War, implying that our elected government is a totalitarian regime.   After Rep. Tom McClintock ( ) had to leave a town hall last week under police guard, and leftists rioted to stop Breitbart Tech editor Mio Yiannopoulos from speaking at UC Berkeley, Republican politicians, understandably, fear for their safety, as Politico’s Rachel Bade reports. But Bade writes, erroneously: “Protesters have disrupted town halls and other public events, jeering and yelling at Republicans just as conservatives did to Democrats when they were writing the law eight years ago. ” There is no equivalence whatsoever. The Tea Party showed up at town halls to be heard the “Resistance” is showing up to stop people from being heard. Moreover, they are doing so against a background of lies by the Democratic Party, which is sowing fear with defamatory   campaigns warning supporters about a “white supremacist” presence in the White House, complete with the sort of “targeting” imagery the media belatedly complained about after the Tucson mass shooting in 2011.  There is a path back to political relevance, and perhaps political power, for the left. It is simple: find policies and messages that appeal to the sort of voters who once backed Obama but switched to Donald Trump last November. Instead, Democrats and their “base” are feeding each other’s hysteria, talking about impeachment as the media openly imagine the assassination of the new president. They are creating justifications for violence, which false comparisons to the Tea Party only reinforce. Joel B. Pollak is Senior    at Breitbart News.

166,Police: Student killed in fight on Cornell campus,2016-08-28," (CNN) One Ithaca College student was killed and another was injured after being stabbed during a ”large fight” on the nearby Cornell University campus early Sunday in Ithaca, New York, officials from both schools said. Cornell University Police were called to the intersection in front of Olin Hall, which houses Cornell’s school of chemical and biomolecular engineering, just before 2 a. m. There, they found two men had been stabbed, according to a police news release.  Police say the fight broke out after a   event at Cornell, according to a statement from Ithaca College.  Several hundred   students attended the event at Willard Straight Hall, the student union, a short walk from the site of the stabbings, and physical altercations broke out after the event, Ithaca police said.  Police did not name the event. The only events on the student union’s calendar late Saturday were movie screenings. There were no events Sunday before 8 a. m. First responders treated the victims, and police recovered the weapon used, the news release said. Efforts to obtain information on the suspect are ongoing, police said.  One victim was sent to a local hospital for treatment of ”serious injuries,” while the other was flown to Upstate Medical Center, a regional trauma center, to be treated for several stab wounds.  Ithaca College President Tom Rochon confirmed both victims were students at the school,  a couple of miles south of Cornell. He also confirmed that one of the students died at Cayuga Medical Center, while the student flown to the trauma center was treated for    injuries. Ithaca police identified the dead student as Anthony Nazaire, 19, of Brooklyn. He was a sophomore studying business administration, Rochon said. ”He graduated from Brooklyn Theatre Arts High School, and at (Ithaca College) he was a member of the executive board of Brothers4Brothers, a student organization dedicated to empowering men of color on our campus,” Rochon’s statement said.  Ithaca police have asked the school not to release the name of the injured student, the statement said.  The injured student was released after treatment, the Ithaca Police Department said. A homicide investigation is underway. Because there were many motorists and pedestrians in the area at the time, anyone who witnessed the fight at the Ivy League school or captured it on cell phone video is encouraged to contact Ithaca police.  ”I hope you will hold these students    along with their families, friends, classmates, and professors    in your thoughts and prayers at this difficult and tragic time,” Rochon’s statement said.  A   gathering is slated for 4 p. m. on Monday in Ithaca College’s Muller Chapel. ”There is nothing more important than the safety of our community as such, this incident is deeply disturbing,” said Ryan Lombardi, Cornell’s vice president for student and campus life, in a statement posted online. ”Please be sure to take care of yourselves and each other throughout the coming days.”"

171,DHS Authorizes Hiring 10K Immigration Officers,2017-02-20,"Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary John F. Kelly authorized the hiring of an additional 10, 000 Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents and enforcement officers. The move by DHS delivers on a promise made by President Donald Trump to increase enforcement —  particularly in removing criminal aliens inside the borders of the U. S.[Secretary Kelly ordered the director of ICE to immediately begin the process of hiring 10, 000 to effectively enforce the immigration laws in the interior regions of the U. S. according to a DHS memo obtained by Breitbart Texas. In addition, Kelly authorized the agency to hire additional operational and mission support staff, along with legal staff.  Kelly said the memo implements the Executive Order, “Enhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States,” issued by President Trump on January 25. ICE agents and enforcement officers were used earlier this month to conduct a targeted roundup of criminal aliens in metropolitan areas across the country. Agents and officers arrested more than 600 criminal aliens in 11 states, Breitbart Texas reported. The operation spawned a rash of “fake news” reports, tweets, and other social media comments that sparked unnecessary fear among immigrants not in the sights of the targeted operation. “I believe ICE is out in public arresting people in order to retaliate against our community for standing up for our values against people like Abbott and Trump,” Austin City Councilman Casar posted on Facebook. “Trump and his allies will do everything they can to divide Americans, invoke fear in vulnerable neighborhoods, and demonize an entire community of people. ” “Of those [680 aliens] arrested, approximately 75 percent were criminal aliens, convicted of crimes including, but not limited to, homicide, aggravated sexual abuse, sexual assault of a minor, lewd and lascivious acts with a child, indecent liberties with a minor, drug trafficking, battery, assault, DUI and weapons charges,” Secretary Kelly wrote in a statement obtained by Breitbart Texas. ICE enforcement officers routinely execute targeted enforcement operations to remove violent criminal aliens from the country. The additional 10, 000 agents and officers will allow the DHS to more efficiently carry out its mission of enforcing immigration laws in the interior of the country. Some of the operations conducted in the past include (according to DHS statistics): The memorandum from Secretary Kelly is effective immediately.

In passing the new regulation, France has joined a long list of countries that have outlawed corporal punishment. Unsurprisingly, the first country to make spanking illegal was Sweden, in 1979, followed by Finland in 1983. The last to join the list before France in 2016 were Mongolia, Paraguay and Slovenia. The decision of the French parliament follows a symbolic reprimand by the Council of Europe in 2015 decrying France’s lack of a specific law “prohibiting corporal punishment in a clear, binding and precise way, including slaps and spankings, in breach of Article 17 of the European Charter of Social Rights. ” “To comply with Article 17, states’ domestic law must prohibit and penalize all forms of violence against children,” the Charter states, and the relevant provisions “must be sufficiently clear, binding and precise, so as to preclude the courts from refusing to apply them to violence against children. ” The legislation barring all corporal punishment reportedly relies on the opinion of a majority of psychologists that such forms of discipline are ineffective or counterproductive. Dr. Gustavo Pietropolli Charmet, a psychiatrist and chairman of the Italian   Help Center for Mistreated Children, said that laws prohibiting corporal punishment are useful because it has become clear that “the educational value of physical and moral pain is zero. ” Suffering “does not strengthen education and does not improve ” Charmet said. “In fact, it can create guilt, fear and vengeance. ” Commenters were quick to express their approval or disapproval with France’s decision. “Life also smacks us from time to time. Will we eliminate those as well? Useless psychologists,” wrote Giulio Francomanno. Another reader noted that spanking “anticipates the lesson that children will learn from life as they grow up, namely, that if you do not respect certain rules, there will be consequences. ” In February 2015, Pope Francis expressed his approval of parents who spank their kids, as long as it is carried out with respect for their dignity. His words drew a wave of reactions, both negative and positive, to the idea that corporal punishment is okay. “It is disappointing that anyone with that sort of influence would make such a comment,” said Peter Newell, the coordinator of the Global Alliance to End Corporal Punishment of Children. Despite the extensive debate regarding the value or detriment of corporal punishment, few have questioned the more problematic aspect of a creeping intromission of the state in the lives of families and their choice of how to educate their children. The Catholic Church teaches that the state should not interfere with parents’ education of children except in grave and extraordinary circumstances. “Since parents have given children their life, they are bound by the most serious obligation to educate their offspring and therefore must be recognized as the primary and principal educators,” Catholic doctrine states.

180,Injured Yazidi toddler to reunite with family,2017-02-13," (CNN) After about four months apart,    Dilbireen Muhsin soon may be reunited with his family. The Yazidi boy, whose name means ”wounded heart” in Kurdish, was brought to the United States late last year to receive medical treatment for severe burns on his face. He was left in the care of a Michigan woman while his parents and newborn brother were in their native Iraq, trying to be by Dilbireen’s side and, mostly recently, facing President Donald Trump’s travel ban. Now, Dilbireen’s parents and brother have been issued visas to come to the United States, a joyous turn of events for a family that has experienced suffering. ”We have confirmation that they have visas in hand, which is great news, and so now we’re organizing travel for them to come to Boston and organizing for Dilbireen to come to Boston from Michigan and resume his treatment,” said Scott LaStaiti, a Los   film producer and philanthropist who helped get Dilbireen medical care.  ”It’s both exciting, because the family will be reunited, and very important, because now he can resume the treatment that he is desperately in need of,” LaStaiti said.  ’The plight of his people’ Dilbireen was one of many Yazidi children needing medical attention when LaStaiti traveled to northern Iraq with Sally Becker, founder of the   charity Road to Peace, in 2015. They traveled to northern Iraq to visit sick and orphaned Yazidi children whose families had fled their homes due to ISIS attacks and were staying at camps for internally displaced persons, Becker said. The US declared last year that ISIS committed genocide against the Yazidis, a minority group in Iraq. Iraqi diplomat Breen Tahseen, son of Yazidi leader Prince Tahseen Bek, invited Becker to visit the camps, where she came    with many children in need of serious medical attention that they couldn’t receive in the surrounding region. ”I arranged to meet with members of Parliament to discuss the possibility of bringing some of the children to Britain, but with a referendum on Brexit looming, it was clear that this was not a priority,” Becker said. In the meantime, her colleague Dr. Shirzad Khaleel, medical coordinator for Road to Peace, gathered names and medical reports for the children. Khaleel wrote in an email that although he has no money to give to the children, he worked as volunteer to help them. ”There were hundreds of cases, but we had to identify which of them would benefit most from treatment abroad, and top of the list was Dilbireen,” Becker said. Dilbireen had been severely burned last year when a heater malfunctioned, exploded and set his crib ablaze. His mother, Flosa Khalaf, was baking bread outside to celebrate Dilbireen’s first birthday when the fire erupted. Flames from the heater severely burned Dilbireen’s face and feet, but a blanket protected the rest of his body. To this day, Dilbireen enjoys cuddling with blankets. ”Born in a camp where his parents have been living since fleeing their home on Sinjar mountain, this amazing and resilient little boy is a symbol of the suffering of the Yazidis and other religious minorities in the region,” Becker said. ”The Yazidis have been victims of many genocides over the centuries, and there are only around 800, 000 left in the world,” she said. ”So this mission isn’t just about helping Dilbireen it’s about highlighting the plight of his people.” Dilbireen’s ’remarkable spirit’ Becker and LaStaiti were able to secure treatment for Dilbireen and a few other children at Shriners Hospitals for Children in Boston, with help from Sameer Sabir, a   entrepreneur in the field of wound healing and burn treatment. Sabir and LaStaiti met through Greg Bailey, a business partner of LaStaiti’s who has also been instrumental in helping Dilbireen. ”I acted as a conduit to help these guys connect to the folks at Boston Shriners, who are amazing people,” Sabir said. ”It really does sort of take a village to make something like this happen, even for one child.” In October, Dilbireen and his father, Ajeel Muhsin, flew with Becker from Iraq to the United States for Dilbireen’s first round of surgeries. Dilbireen’s mother stayed in Iraq, as she was due to give birth to Dilbireen’s brother in November.  Doctors in Boston first saw Dilbireen on October 6 and developed a treatment plan that included a series of surgeries to restore his facial appearance and function, such as being able to open and close his mouth. Muhsin planned to return to Iraq for the baby’s birth, and then the family together would travel to the US for Dilbireen’s additional surgeries. They would return to Iraq once Dilbireen was completely treated. News about Dilbireen spread across the Yazidi community in the United States. Saman Ali, a    Yazidi, was eager to help when he heard about how Muhsin and Dilbireen needed an interpreter while they were in Boston for the boy’s first round of surgeries. Ali graduated from Pennsylvania State University with a master’s degree in law in 2015. He drove seven or eight hours from State College, Pennsylvania, to Boston to help Muhsin and Dilbireen with translations, Becker said. ”He was a blessing in disguise. I don’t know how we could have managed without him,” said Tatyana Goldwyn, widow of plastic surgeon Robert Goldwyn, who helped raise funds and find housing for Muhsin and Dilbireen in Boston. She is based in the greater Boston area and continues to help Dilbireen’s family.  ”The father was a very young man and was alone here . .. and the child had been traumatized by the separation from his mother,” Goldwyn said. ”We found an apartment that was donated during their stay. We provided everything from toothpaste to formula, you name it.” The organization House of Peace also has helped provide housing for Dilbireen and his father.  Ron Burkle, an American investor and philanthropist, made a generous donation to help Dilbireen and his family, LaStaiti, the film producer, said. LaStaiti added that he made the connection to Burkle through British film producer Lex Lutzus, who helped raise funds. ”For a child who has been through so much, he has such a remarkable spirit and was always smiling and always happy, which was just very uplifting, actually,” Sabir said of Dilbireen. In November, Dilbireen moved to Lansing, Michigan, to stay with Adlay Kejjan, director of the Yazidi American Women Organization, while he recovered after his first round of surgeries.  Muhsin, the boy’s father, traveled to Iraq to be with Khalaf while she gave birth to Dilbireen’s brother on November 9. The family named the baby Trump. ”America is helping us to do surgery on our boy,” Muhsin said in an interview from Iraq two weeks ago. His comments were translated from Kurdish. ”We want to show our appreciation to America for what they are doing for our boy.” Then, chaos and confusion erupted. A young family to be reunited, When Muhsin and Khalaf applied for a passport and visa for baby Trump to travel to the US to see his brother last month, their application was denied, and then the visas they already had were revoked. Though Trump was not in office when Dilbireen’s family was initially denied visas, the executive order that was signed January 27 to keep certain people from entering the country had the family worried. The order indicated that immigrants from seven predominantly Muslim nations    Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia    were unable to enter the country for at least the next 90 days.  Dilbireen’s parents submitted new applications to the US consulate in Erbil, Iraq, but when they arrived at the consulate for an appointment last week, they were refused entry. Then, this week, they were granted their visas. ”His mom, Flosa, and his father, Ajeel, and his baby brother, Trump, were granted their visas at the US consulate in Erbil, and they did walk out yesterday with visas actually stamped in their passports,” LaStaiti said Monday. All three visas for Muhsin, Khalaf and baby Trump have been approved, a spokeswoman for Sen. Debbie Stabenow’s office said Monday.  The Michigan Democrat’s office confirmed that it received information from the State Department that the visas were approved this week. Meanwhile, Kejjan, a paramedic and pilot in Michigan who is also Yazidi, is continuing to care for Dilbireen until his family arrives in the US.  ”If he was older, he would definitely say, ’I want my parents, my mom and dad.’ He’s so young, and he doesn’t understand,” Kejjan said in an exclusive interview with CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Sanjay Gupta two weeks ago. ’It takes a village’ LaStaiti, the film producer, and Becker, founder of Road to Peace, both said that they are grateful for Kejjan and many others who have helped Dilbireen along this journey. ”This experience has definitely been bigger than any one person. It’s fair to use that expression, it takes a village,” LaStaiti said.  ”I hope we can create a sustainable model so that resources are readily available for these children in need,” he said. ”I hope that now that we have made these contacts and connections on both the   side and on the hospital side, it will be easier to place kids as we identify them.” It cost about $15, 000 and involved dozens of people to arrange treatment for Dilbireen and reunite him with his family, Becker said. ”I have been doing this since 1993, when I found injured kids in the besieged city of Mostar. Back then, it was Christians and Muslims. Now, it’s the Yazidis,” she said. ”Race or religion is irrelevant to me. These are innocent victims of a war not of their making and beyond their understanding.” Many other refugee children in Iraq are in need of specialized medical attention, said Becker, who has identified about 87. Becker said she is working with local partners, the Heraion Foundation, to open a children’s hospital in northern Iraq so children will no longer need to travel around the world for specialized medical attention. Becker said her inspiration comes from children like Dilbireen."
181,Mississippi Senate Passes Bill Allowing Churches to Arm Congregants - Breitbart,2016-03-31,"On March 29 the Mississippi Senate passed a bill that will allow each church to designate a certain number of congregants as armed guards for the defense of the congregation as a whole. [The measure —  the Mississippi Church Protection Act (HB 786) —  passed by a vote of  .  According to Fox News, Senate Judiciary (Div. A) Committee Chairman Sean Tindell ( ) pointed out that defense of church congregations is paramount following the June 2015 attack on Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina. He indicated that church members already have the means to defend themselves, but churches need the legal protections to allow members to do so. The Mississippi Church Protection Act provides that legal protection. Tindell said, “The   of these churches is a   right. ” The Mississippi Church Protection Act was vocally opposed by senator Hillman Frazier ( ) who wore a sheathed sword into the senate chamber. Frazier argued against defensive action by “[citing] the story of Jesus healing the high priest’s servant after a disciple cut off the servant’s ear as Jesus was being arrested. ” He did not mention Luke 22:36, in which Christ emphasized the need for his swords, ostensibly for a defensive purpose. Christ said, “But now if you have a purse, take it, and also a bag and if you don’t have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one. ” The Mississippi Church Protection Act also contains a provision barring the enforcement of any federal firearm law that violates Mississippi’s constitutional protections of the right to keep and bear arms. And it expands the ability to carry a handgun without a permit from simply carrying in a purse or bag to carrying a holstered firearm.

182,"A Glass Ceiling Now Broken, Is U.S. Ready for a Madam President? - The New York Times",2016-07-31,"PHILADELPHIA  —   First a black president and now, just maybe, a woman. Karen Willis, an   delegate to this week’s Democratic convention here, was exhilarated by the historic possibilities of Hillary Clinton’s election run, viewing it as a natural succession to Barack Obama’s eight years in power. But when it comes to persuading voters, she noted, Mrs. Clinton’s gender milestone was the one thing her party was likely to play down. “We don’t want to offend some of the white men out there who may not take too well to a first woman,” said Ms. Willis, who is from San Diego, citing internal party talking points. “We don’t want to rub it in their faces that she’s a woman, any more than we rubbed it in their faces that Barack Obama was black. It makes sense. ” As the United States kicks off an unprecedented presidential campaign contest this week, setting Mrs. Clinton against her Republican opponent, Donald J. Trump, the sensitivities of the country’s gender politics are bubbling to the surface. Americans find themselves confronted with an uncomfortable question: Are they really ready to accept a Madam President? The soaring optimism of Mrs. Clinton’s address to her party in Philadelphia, with its promises of breaking the world’s highest glass ceiling, comes against the backdrop of a contest notable for its misogynistic discourse. Casual prejudices once reserved for the locker room or the bar stool have been projected loudly onto a national stage, mostly from the podium of Mr. Trump, who has variously described women as fat pigs, dogs and slobs, and blamed their menstrual cycles for criticism of him. In particular, he has accused Mrs. Clinton of playing the “woman’s card. ” Beyond Mr. Trump’s schoolboy imprecations, the bilious environment has drawn attention to the more serious issue of the United States’ record of putting women in positions of power. American popular culture celebrates women who combine power and success, like Sheryl K. Sandberg, the Facebook executive whose prescriptions on balancing a   career with family life are received with great solemnity. In government, American diplomats monitor human rights in other nations and can be outspoken against egregious abuses involving women, like acid attacks and honor killings, in poor countries. But despite progress toward gender equality in recent decades, women struggle to achieve equal pay or seniority to men of equivalent qualification in business, even in liberal bastions like Hollywood. The gap is most striking in politics. After a surge in female members of Congress in the early 1990s, rates have stalled or fallen back currently, 20 percent of representatives and senators are women, far below the 30 percent goal set by a United Nations conference on women. The World Economic Forum, in its latest Global Gender Gap report, ranked the United States 72nd of 145 countries for political empowerment, trailing countries like Cuba, Cape Verde and Kenya. In part, experts say, the American system is at fault. The presidential nominating process, with its long and ruinously expensive campaigns, is tougher on nonconventional candidates than the parliamentary system is in many countries. And American politicians are averse to the quotas that helped increase female participation in other countries. Badges and   deriding Mrs. Clinton in obscene terms or using sexual slurs are common at Trump rallies. But women who have succeeded in Washington also point to deeply ingrained male chauvinism as a powerful impediment to success. Madeleine Albright, the United States’ first female secretary of state, recalled in an interview how she had often encountered more resistance from American colleagues than from the Arab heads of state she had been warned about. “It was the little things,” she said. When she raised her voice in meetings, “men would say, ‘Don’t be so emotional,’ or would drum their fingers on the table and say I was talking too long  —   when the men actually talked much longer. ” Similar attitudes endure today, powerful women say. Shamila N. Chaudhary, a former Obama administration official now at New America, a think tank in Washington, said she encountered workplace friction with male subordinates every day. “People don’t like women to be leaders,” she said. “They get angry. It’s always about my demeanor or my tone. I tell them I’m just trying to get the work done. ” Female politicians in other countries hope that Mrs. Clinton’s run will set an example for them, too. Joyce Laboso, the deputy speaker of Kenya’s Parliament, who was in Philadelphia this week, said she had followed Mrs. Clinton’s campaign with a mix of envy and empathy. Back home she, too, had endured taunts from men who questioned her suitability to run for office, or who said she had the wrong husband for the job (although in her case, it was because her spouse is from another ethnic group). “Men say that positions of authority are not our sphere,” she said. “But if Hillary becomes president, that myth will be shattered. ” If she wins, Mrs. Clinton promises more than symbolism. But away from the curated,   environment of the convention, with its rousing slogans, the coming battle with Mr. Trump is likely to feature further ad hominem attacks. “I’m taking the gloves off,” he  said at a rally in Colorado Springs on Friday. Just as Mr. Trump was accused of using   tactics to attack Mr. Obama  —   by supporting, for instance, the “birther” conspiracy theories claiming that Mr. Obama had been born in Kenya  —   Mr. Trump could well return to attacks based on gender. It’s not just Mr. Trump, though. Mrs. Clinton suffers from unusually high negative ratings from voters, including many women, who see her as an impenetrable figure whose life has been framed by compromised politics and the ultimate power marriage. Some were uncomfortable with a convention speech this week by her husband, Bill Clinton, that tried to paint her as an object of desire. Surveys show that young people, in particular, do not trust her. Many young female supporters of her opponent in the race for the Democratic nomination, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, said they resented being pressured into supporting her on the basis of her sex. “I get it that some people just don’t know what to make of me,” Mrs. Clinton admitted during the convention. The gender debate, both overt and coded, is part of the broader tumult of a campaign that has challenged many core notions of American political identity, and that has been filled with astonishing turns. In just the past week, Mr. Trump called for Russian intelligence agencies to find Mrs. Clinton’s missing emails, only to retract the statement as an apparent joke. At the Democratic convention, former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York suggested that Mr. Trump was not sane. In an electrifying moment, the father of a fallen Muslim American soldier brandished a copy of the Constitution on stage and waved it at Mr. Trump. “You have sacrificed nothing and no one,” he said. Mrs. Clinton’s advisers have debated how much they should focus on gender in the coming months. Many see parallels with the delicate balancing act of 2008, when the party sought to reassure some voters about Mr. Obama. Ms. Willis, the delegate, said she had been told then that “we can’t make race an issue, because there are some people out there who might not take well to that. ” But in Philadelphia, at least, Mrs. Clinton owned her historic achievement. Her first appearance, on a video screen, showed her surrounded by the shards of a shattering glass ceiling. During the speeches, some delegates  —   men as well as women  —   cried openly. “It’s the end of a long struggle,” Representative John Lewis, a civil rights champion from Georgia, told MSNBC just before Mrs. Clinton was officially nominated. “I cried when Barack Obama was nominated, cried when he was elected, cried when he was sworn in. And I may cry again tonight. ”"

Stone was also President and CEO of SEGA Entertainment from 1994 to 2004, and has served on the boards of multiple electronic entertainment companies since. In an interview that highlighted his work at NanoTech, he called Nintendo and SEGA “magnificent places to work” and talked about the institution of a “  development system” as one of the highlights of his career. Alan Stone was one of the pioneers of   game development. Because of him, numerous other companies were given the chance to develop games for the innovative hardware that Nintendo was producing. Stone kickstarted the Western video game industry into the   dollar behemoth it is today. Despite being a relatively unknown figure outside the industry, he was both directly and indirectly responsible for much of its landscape. UDC’s Michael Green paid a heartfelt tribute to his friend: It was with great sadness that I read that Alan Stone, one of my oldest and best friends has died. He had bravely fought that terrible disease, yet throughout all maintained his dignity and humour. We became friends when he was running Nintendo! and we became the UK distributor. He was a businessman with the highest integrity and the finest business ethic. He went on to do a magnificent job as president of Sega USA. He built up so many friendships over the years that have endured till today. Hilary and I had so many great times with Al and Darlene that we will always treasure.

185,NASA scientist Stofan: ’Indications’ of alien life by 2025,2015-04-08," (CNN) They may not be ”Star Trek”  extraterrestrials, but we may be close to finding evidence of alien life, a NASA scientist says. ”I think we’re going to have strong indications of life beyond Earth within a decade, and I think we’re going to have definitive evidence within 20 to 30 years,” NASA chief scientist Ellen Stofan said Tuesday during a panel discussion on water in the universe. ”We know where to look. We know how to look,” she said. ”In most cases, we have the technology, and we’re on a path to implementing it. And so I think we’re definitely on the road.” NASA released a graphic noting that scientists have found evidence or indications of water on a number of celestial bodies, including the dwarf planet Ceres and Jupiter’s moon Europa. The Hubble Space Telescope has been key to the discoveries, NASA said in a news release. ”Scientists using NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope recently provided powerful evidence that (Jupiter’s moon) Ganymede has a saltwater,   ocean, likely sandwiched between two layers of ice,” the agency noted. There are some caveats involved, of course. NASA isn’t talking about intelligent alien civilizations from the Alpha Quadrant it’s referring to microorganisms. ”We are not talking about little green men,” Stofan said at the panel. ”We are talking about little microbes.” Still, former astronaut John Grunsfeld said it’s an exciting time    and he thinks it’s just a matter of time before we find life outside our solar system as well. ”I think we’re one generation away in our solar system, whether it’s on an icy moon or on Mars, and one generation on a planet around a nearby star,” he said.  And, he added, who knows what that life will look like? ”Once we get out beyond Mars, the likelihood that it’s similar to Earth because we share that material gets very, very low,” he said. ”And I think that’s where it starts getting exceptionally exciting.”"
186,"Illegal Aliens Rally for Sanctuary for Aliens, Muslims, LGBTs",2016-12-17,"Illegal aliens and supporters for a sanctuary city stood out in the rain in front of the city’s administration building on Thursday chanting, “Not on our watch,” and “One city, one fight. ” They want protection for illegal aliens, Muslims, and the LGBT community. [The Merced Sun Star reported about the gathering and press conference in Merced, California, a city located in Merced County in the Central Valley of Northern California. The population of the city is just a little over 80, 000 people.  A group called the Merced Organizing Project were reported to be thinking about asking city and county officials for solutions in becoming a “regional sanctuary” for illegal aliens. The report said supporters of the idea began talking about the idea after the election of Donald Trump. Members of the group, and another group called Faith in the Valley PICO partners, were said to be urging President Barack Obama to protect illegal aliens, and to give clemency for nonviolent drug offenders who are in jail. The PICO group are from five counties in California  —   Fresno, Kern, Merced, San Joaquin and Stanislaus. The call for a sanctuary city for illegal aliens in California is just the latest in the move by open border activists and Democrats to dig their heels in for sanctuary city protection. As reported by Breitbart Texas in   after the presidential election, the mayors of New York City, Seattle, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Chicago, and Providence showed great defiance at any suggestion of an   city law that would apply nationwide. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel said after the November 8th election, “Chicago always will be a sanctuary city,” NPR reported.  “To all those who are, after Tuesday’s election, very nervous and filled with anxiety   …     you are safe in Chicago, you are secure in Chicago and you are supported in Chicago. ” Chicago has some of the highest crime and murder rates of any city in the nation. This year, as Breitbart News reported in October, homicides had reached almost 600 in the   city. Breitbart Texas reported on Wednesday that there are forty sanctuary cities that are   on their commitment to open border,   sanctuary city immigration policies. Austin in Texas, and Berkeley, Los Angeles, Oakland, Richmond, and San Francisco in California are among the cities. New York, New York, Boston, Denver, Detroit, Jersey City, New Haven, Philadelphia, Phoenix, Portland, Syracuse, St. Paul and Tuscon are some of the cities among those listed. Texas is moving forward with legislation to block sanctuary city policies in the Lone Star State. State Senator Charles Perry ( ) introduced legislation in   to ban sanctuary cities in Texas, Breitbart Texas reported. The murderer of Kathryn Steinle, as reported by Breitbart California, said during an interview that he came to San Francisco because he knew he would not be deported. Juan Francisco   had been deported five times and was a   convicted felon. Mary Ann Mendoza, the mother of a police officer who was killed by a drunk illegal alien told Breitbart Texas: “When elected officials start taking actions to protect illegal criminals and as some have stated, using taxpayer money to offer legal assistance, you have to wonder what place Americans who have been affected by illegal crime have in this big picture. We are now becoming the group in the shadows, ignored by local politicians, shunned by mainstream media and standing on the sidelines watching illegal criminals getting more benefits and protection then our loved ones ever got. This insanity and the power hungry politicians using these issues for votes (from illegal aliens) to stay in office sickens me. Americans matter, Americans need protection and Americans should come first, after all, we do live in America, right?” Ms. Mendoza lost her son, Mesa Police Sergeant Brandon Mendoza, to an intoxicated criminal illegal alien. The    police officer from Mesa, Arizona, was killed when the drunk illegal alien drove down the wrong way on a highway. Mendoza said her son’s killer had previously been charged with burglary, assault of a peace officer, and fraud. He never appeared in court and was on the run for 12 years. He was caught at the border and they took him to Colorado where he was shown leniency and released. Ms. Mendoza said that “Donald Trump is the change this country needs,” Breitbart Texas reported in June. Breitbart News reported in late May that Sabine Durden, whose    son Dominic was murdered by an illegal alien, said she “lost it” when Donald Trump kissed her son’s poster. A video in the article captured Trump’s interaction with mothers who had lost their children to violence by criminal illegal aliens. Durden said that Dominic’s killer had committed two felonies but pleaded them down to one. He was deported and illegally returned and committed two DUI offenses for which he received probation. During the first DUI probation she said, he was caught again, and received probation. Three weeks later the criminal illegal alien killed her son by running into Dominic on his motorcycle with his truck. He was just under the legal limit for DUI. She said that despite what he had done, the criminal illegal alien only received a misdemeanor without gross negligence and a nine   years probation sentence. He only served 35 days. Durden told Breitbart Texas: “As a legal immigrant and now citizen, I take great offense to their action. It’s a slap in the face of every citizen, immigrant, and those going through the legal process of becoming citizens. We are a country of laws and those officials who think they are above the law need to be removed from office and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. The money and time spent on people that are here illegally comes out of the pocket of taxpayers and needs to be used on citizens and their needs. I can’t just walk into the mayor’s home with my family and demand he now has to take care of me because I don’t like where I live. ” The grieving mother asked, “Where is a sanctuary place for us victims to get away from the pain and grief caused by an illegal alien?” Lana Shadwick is a writer and legal analyst for Breitbart Texas.

187,"1 killed, 11 wounded at birthday party in Detroit",2015-06-21," (CNN) A shooting at a child’s birthday party that left one person dead and 11 wounded was a retaliation, Detroit Police Chief James Craig told WXYZ on Sunday. Attackers fired semiautomatic weapons Saturday night at the party attended by about 300 people, police said. Earlier reports said nine people were wounded. Police think the shooting was retaliation, Craig said to WXYZ. He noted the    man who died had been shot about a month ago.  Four of the injured people are still hospitalized, Craig told WXYZ. No children were shot, People in the neighborhood are not helping officers find the shooters, Craig said. ”You will allow this to continue if you do nothing,” he said of the neighborhood. ”We can’t do it alone. This is not the time to be fearful. These are urban terrorists who do nothing positive for our neighborhoods.” Dolunt said police are looking for the owner of an abandoned red car found across the street whose occupants they believe were shot.

188,5 takeaways from CNN/ORC poll,2015-04-20,"Washington (CNN) The first ballots of the 2016 campaign won’t be cast for nearly a year but the contours of the race are already coming into focus. There are plenty of caveats to   at this early stage of the political cycle    many candidates are still unknown and the sentiment in early states like Iowa and New Hampshire carry much more weight than national statistics. Still, national polls do offer an important snapshot of how the public views each of the candidates right now  —   and the campaigns are using that insight to shape their early agendas. At this point in the race, it’s clear that the Republican side of the race is far from gelling while Democrats    including liberals    are solidifying behind Hillary Clinton. But beyond the   horserace numbers, a peek under the hood of Monday’s   poll reveals some intriguing trends about the 2016 race. Here are some highlights: 1. Marco Rubio got a bounce. Rand Paul did not. Even though he announced his presidential campaign on April 7, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul’s standing among Republicans (11%) actually declined by one point since the last   poll in  . So much for that announcement bounce.  Marco Rubio, though, juiced his numbers following his announcement in Miami last week. The Florida senator is now polling at 11% among GOP voters, an increase from 7% last week and just 3% last November.  The numbers suggest that Rubio’s rollout, which included several media interviews, was an   success that impressed Republicans and reminded them of his relative youth, charisma, speaking abilities and dexterity with an   media. Importantly, he was also able to break through   level coverage of Hillary Clinton’s   announcement. That 11% number is far from frontrunner status  —   his former mentor Jeb Bush is in the lead at 17%  —   but Rubio is now back in the conversation among Republicans who wrote him off throughout 2014. He took that momentum with him to a New Hampshire GOP summit over the weekend, where he was one of the most celebrated speakers among the many Republicans who attended. 2. The fundamentals of Bush’s numbers are strong, Bush is hardly a   GOP frontrunner at 17% and Rubio presented himself last week as a   and credible rival who will have to be taken seriously by that other campaign across town in Miami. But it appears Bush’s lead might be built on more than just his famous, if controversial, last name. On a range of qualities  —   leadership, experience, electability  —   Bush has even wider leads among his Republican opponents. Among Republicans, 21% said Bush ”would be the strongest leader,” 18% said ”he cares the most about people like you,” 26% said he has ”the best chance of beating the Democratic nominee” next year, and 27% said he has ”the right experience to be president.” No one else in the GOP field comes close to those numbers.  The former Florida governor still must quell doubts among conservatives about some of his positions and   rhetoric. Unlike his opponents, most Republicans know who Bush is, and he’s still not cracking 20% of the GOP vote. But Bush is starting off on firmer ground than his opponents  —   and they know it. 3. Christie is still in the game, At first glance, Chris Christie 2016 looks like a  . After a miserable winter full of   political wounds  —   vaccinations, anyone?  —   Christie seems to have fallen off the radar nationally, coming in at just 4% in the   poll. But look again: Christie is the second choice of 11% of Republicans, suggesting that he’s still in the mix and has a chance to prove himself to skeptical Republicans. In other words, Christie is still on their minds. Christie’s numbers are actually higher in New Hampshire, where his advisers believe he can   his standing by taking his town hall act to one town after another in the style of John McCain, who resurrected his    campaign in the state back in 2008. It’s a tough road ahead, but the   Christie is one of the best political performers in the Republican field. He is not to be dismissed. 4. Clinton gets stronger without Warren in the field, Because Elizabeth Warren is  —   gasp!  —   not running for president,   decided not to include Elizabeth Warren’s name in the Democratic mix in this poll, the first time that’s been the case this cycle. Conventional wisdom  —   often wrong, of course ��� holds that the progressive Warren would be the ideal challenger to Clinton from the left.  But Clinton actually runs stronger in the poll when Warren is left off the list of candidates and potential candidates. In March, Clinton was the choice of 62% of Democrats, to Warren’s 10%. Without Warren, Clinton’s support among Democrats jumps seven points  —   to 69%.  Clinton’s poll numbers undoubtedly spiked thanks to the tremendous media buzz swirling around her 2016 campaign announcement last week. But the fact that a good chunk of Warren’s support has moved in Clinton’s direction undercuts the notion that the left is wholly uncomfortable with her becoming the Democratic Party’s  . It will be up to her other likely challengers  —   Martin O’Malley, Bernie Sanders and Jim Webb  —   to remind Democrats of why they should be skeptical of Clinton redux. 5. But is Clinton honest and trustworthy? Clinton scores high marks on a number of qualities. Almost 90 percent of Democrats see her as being ”strong and decisive,” having a vision, and caring ”about people like you.” More than 80% say she represents ”the future of the Democratic Party”  —   quite a feat for someone who has been involved with politics for almost 40 years. But Clinton’s numbers dip on a key question: On the topic of whether she is ”honest and trustworthy,” Clinton hits a ceiling of 75%. That’s a high number to be sure, but it hints at a potential weak spot for Clinton among Democrats  —   especially as the story about her personal email use as Secretary of State continues to percolate. Among all voters, a recent Quinnipiac poll of swing states showed her ratings on that quality to be even worse: Majorities in Iowa, Colorado and Virginia said she was not honest and trustworthy. Both Bill and Hillary Clinton have long been hounded by accusations that they dance around the truth, keep secrets and aren’t up front with voters. Polling, it seems, still bears that out. And it’s a prime reason that O’Malley, the former governor of Maryland who is hoping to pick up progressive support, has spent the last week reminding anyone who will listen that Clinton has changed her positions over the years on issues like immigration and   marriage.

189,How Small Forests Can Help Save the Planet - The New York Times,2016-09-27,"BIRKENFELD, Ore.  —   Eve Lonnquist’s family has owned a forest in the mountains of northwest Oregon since her grandmother bought the land in 1919. Her    father still lives on the   property. And she and her wife often drive up from their home just outside Portland. But lately, Ms. Lonnquist, 59 and recently retired, has been thinking about the future of her family’s land. Like many   owners, they draw some income from logging and would like to keep doing so. But they would also like to see the forest, with its stands of Douglas fir, alder and cherry, protected from   or being sold off to developers. “For us, the property is our family’s history,” she said. More than half of the 751 million acres of forestland in the United States are privately owned, most by people like Ms. Lonnquist, with holdings of 1, 000 acres or less. These family forests, environmental groups argue, represent a large, untapped resource for combating the effects of climate change. Conserving the trees and profiting from them might seem incompatible. But Ms. Lonnquist is hoping to do both by capitalizing on the forest’s ability to clean the air, turning the carbon stored in the forest into credits that can then be sold to polluters who want or need to offset their carbon footprints. “Trees are the No. 1 way in which carbon can be removed from the atmosphere and stored in vegetation over the long term,” said Brian Kittler, the western regional office director for the Pinchot Institute for Conservation, which has a program in Oregon to help the owners of family forests develop potentially profitable carbon projects. Larger forests around the world have already been enlisted as carbon storehouses, through programs like the United Nations initiative for Reducing Emissions From Deforestation and Forest Degradation, or REDD, that encourage forest conservation worldwide in exchange for credits that can be sold on the global carbon markets. Some large timber companies, including Potlatch, have also entered the markets, reducing their logging to levels below legal limits in order to receive millions of dollars in credits. But so far,   owners, even   ones like Ms. Lonnquist, have not rushed to embrace   carbon storage. Many do not even know it exists, and those who do often find the complexities bewildering. Some owners believe, wrongly, that to enter the carbon markets they must forgo all income from logging. And some, reluctant to forfeit the ability to quickly turn their trees into cash, have balked at signing a contract to keep a forest standing for 15 to 125 years. Even more daunting, the expense of bringing a forest to the carbon market  —   a process that involves taking an inventory of the trees, assessing the forest’s carbon content, estimating future growth, and submitting to several levels of auditing  —   has been so high that it would eliminate any profit for most small landholders. Environmental organizations like the Pinchot Institute and the Nature Conservancy have for years been searching for a way around these hurdles by educating landowners about the markets’ potential for generating income and finding ways to decrease the costs. “Traditionally, your only tool to generate revenues has been periodic timber harvest,” said Josh Parrish, director of the Nature Conservancy’s Working Woodlands program, which is working with the owners of private forests in Pennsylvania and Tennessee. “The nice thing about carbon is essentially people are being paid to improve forest management. ” In fact, if   owners can get past the barriers, the carbon markets can be profitable, providing an initial flush of money and then regular yearly payments in much smaller amounts. The carbon credits from Ms. Lonnquist’s forest could bring an estimated $235, 000 over the first six years, and about $6, 000 a year after that, said Kyle Holland, the managing director of Ecological Carbon Offset Partners, a California firm that helps   owners enter the carbon markets. Ms. Lonnquist and her family could still log on a limited basis, as long as they stuck to a plan for managing the forest and maintained a steady level of carbon storage through the forest’s continued growth. The economic case for private owners entering the carbon markets is likely to get stronger. Forests, especially in areas like the Northwest, where trees grow tall and thick, tend to draw higher prices than many other conservation measures. And with last year’s Paris climate pact, some analysts expect carbon prices, now about $3 to $12 per ton in the United States, to rise. Mr. Kittler said the conservation institute, which is subsidizing the preparation of Ms. Lonnquist’s forest with the help of a grant from the Department of Agriculture and has partnered with Mr. Holland’s firm for the Oregon project, hoped it would encourage more private owners to enter the markets. Ms. Lonnquist and other owners will be given a choice of selling credits on the global market or on California’s market, created under the state’s 2006 Global Warming Solutions Act. Recent developments in forestry may help make the prospect more appealing by lowering the initial costs to landholders. Mr. Holland’s company, for example, has developed a digital tool  —   a smartphone equipped with a laser to measure distance and an inclinometer to measure height  —   that he believes will greatly reduce the expense of conducting a forest inventory, which typically costs $40, 000 to $100, 000 or more, depending about the amount of land. With the specialized smartphone, landholders can take an inventory themselves, photographing and measuring the diameters and heights of their trees. The photos and data are sent to the company’s office in California, where an expert forester goes through the images, identifying the species and checking for damage to the branches or crowns, among other things. Probability models are used to calculate the amount of carbon stored in the forest. The mathematical proofs developed by the company have been submitted to a scientific journal, Mr. Holland said. Using traditional methods, a forester conducting an inventory averages three or four forest plots per day and can spend months completing an assessment at a cost of $350 a plot, he said. But Logan Sander, a forester who used the smartphone to inventory Ms. Lonnquist’s forest and recently demonstrated it for two visitors, said he was averaging 30 to 35 plots a day, with the entire job taking only a week to complete. Individual forest owners who sign up for Mr. Holland’s service pay a $75 application fee and receive the smartphone. If, after conducting an inventory, they choose to move forward with the carbon project, they pay the company $1, 350 to complete the process. Some small properties do not store enough carbon to make even that effort worthwhile. The price of carbon, Mr. Holland said, has to be $10 or more per ton “to make it pencil out” for the owner. And novel methods like Mr. Holland’s still need approval from the companies that verify forest inventories or serve as official market registries. But Jessica Orrego, the director of forestry for the American Carbon Registry, said such advances might be the key to bringing in   owners. “We’re fully supportive,” she said. “We’re advocates of innovation. We think it’s extremely important in the carbon market. ” Ms. Lonnquist, who owns the forest here with two brothers and her wife, Lynn Baker, is still considering whether entering the carbon markets would make sense for her family. The commitment  —   125 years if the credits are sold in the California market  —   gives her some pause, she said. “That’s well beyond our lifetime, and that’s a commitment that goes with the property,” she said. She can imagine, though, what she might be doing 20 years from now. “Maybe I’d just be at home growing carbon,” she said. “And maybe that’s the best thing. ”"
190,"Limbaugh on the Media: ‘Nothing More Than a Circle Jerk,’ ‘Do Not Know What They’re Talking About’ - Breitbart",2016-11-21,"Monday on his radio show, host Rush Limbaugh took a call from a Tennessee man who insisted Limbaugh was looking at the media incorrectly.  According to the caller, conservatives should be grateful for the media’s biased coverage because it is having the opposite impact of what was intended. In the case of Donald Trump versus Hillary Clinton, the media’s slant for Clinton was a net positive for Trump, he argued. Limbaugh told the caller he wasn’t attempting to discourage the media from doing, because he argued it would matter anyway. Instead he said he was attempting to help his listeners “decipher” and “understand” what the media are doing and described what the media do as “nothing more than a circle jerk. ” “I do what I always do,” Limbaugh replied. “I’m trying to help people decipher it and understand it. I don’t think they’re going to change. Look, it’s nothing more than a circle jerk. These people do not know what they’re talking about. It’s been demonstrated  —   whatever show, whatever panel.

191,"Iraqi Journalist: Islamic State Motivated By Islam, Not Insanity",2016-02-02,"TEL AVIV  —   An article in a   Iraqi daily denounced the widespread notion that Islamic State terror has nothing to do with Islam, stating IS’s belief that “a day will arrive when Muslims inundate Europe and subdue it to Islam,” continuing, “Is this not enough to convince us that terror does have a religion?” [The article, titled “Does terror truly have no religion?” translated by MEMRI, was published in   and authored by Iraqi journalist Fadel Boula. In it, Boula objects to the claim frequently repeated in the Arab world that IS atrocities are the result of “insanity” and are unrelated to Islam.  Boula asserts that IS and other terror organizations are motivated by an extremist Salafi ideology and their members maintain the belief that their actions represent Allah’s will and directives. He condemns the idea that IS’s actions are unrelated to Islam as naïve and ignoring the facts, “as though there are no religious goals or values behind [the terror] but only a state of insanity that causes those afflicted with it to run amok, unaware of what they are doing or what [they seek] to achieve by their actions. ” Boula adds that the terror being carried out all over the world is not the work of “savage tribes,” but committed by conscious human beings who are “inspired by a religious ideology” that “espouses religious extremism” and subscribe to the “force of the sword. ” These people are trained to kill themselves and others in order to attain martyrdom. Boula then outlines the history of modern terror groups that act in the name of religion, claiming that their inception occurred around the time Islamic militants declared jihad on Soviet forces in Afghanistan in the 1980s. Boula traces IS’s Al Qaeda origins and notes the terrorist group’s aspirations to emulate early Islamic conquests by establishing a Caliphate for Muslims. “Thus, a scary organization [namely IS] suddenly appeared, which advertises itself as the bearer of Islam’s message and banner,” writes Boula. IS leader Abu Bakr   aimed to show the Iraqi people, and specifically the IS stronghold of Mosul, what it’s like to be ruled by a government that is a throwback to 1, 400 years ago. “The invaders attacked the populace of Mosul and eastern Syria, arrested them by the hundreds, and took a sword to their necks, and later singled out the Christians among them and offered them two options: either convert to Islam or pay the poll tax, as happened to their forefathers when the Arabs attacked their lands in the days of the Caliph ‘Umar   [  AD],” notes Boula. He adds that the plight of the Yazidis is “a historic disaster that was inflicted upon them by the   Caliph [ ]. ” Terrorists “who butcher their victims while crying out in the name of Allah the merciful and ‘Allah akbar’ is a testament to their belief that they are carrying out Allah’s will. “All these crimes are carried out with Allah’s approval, and they are perpetrated by those who praise Allah day and night and who pray fervently and do everything according to His will. ” Noting the Paris attacks that were “done with Allah’s approval,” Boula reiterates IS’s threat that the next attack will be on U. S. soil. Boula concludes that terrorists pray that “in the wake of this terrorist momentum, a day will arrive when Muslims inundate Europe and subdue it to Islam. Is this not enough to convince [us] that terror [does] have a religion?”"
192,DREAMers Arrested in Nationwide Gang Crackdown,2017-05-11,"Federal immigration officials arrested nearly 1, 400 gang members in a nationwide   operation, including illegal immigrants gang members who had protected status under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. [Altogether, 1, 378 gang members were arrested by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency, 1, 098 of which already have federal or state criminal charges against them, according to a news release.   of the members had pending murder charges against them, while another seven were facing rape allegations. The other 280 were arrested for being in the U. S. illegally.  Three of the gang members arrested in the ICE operation had protected status as illegal immigrants under the   DACA program. Since DACA’s inception, more than 1, 500 illegal immigrants have had their protected status revoked after they were found to be involved with a gang or committed a crime. DACA recipients are given protection by the federal government and since the Trump Administration has not ended the program, experts like Mark Krikorian have previously said that 800 new permits for protected DACA status can be granted by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) every day. “They’re still processing these work permits,” Krikorian told Breitbart Texas at the time. “That’s got to end at the absolute minimum. ” Additionally, of the 1, 478 gang members arrested, 10 of them had crossed the U. S.  Brder as unaccompanied minors. Of those 10, nine were confirmed gang members and eight of those 10 were   specifically. Most recently, Breitbart Texas reported on the continued resettlement of foreign unaccompanied minors into    regions of the U. S. despite experts pointing to evidence that this process allows foreign crime syndicates to flourish. Since the beginning of the Fiscal Year, October 1, 2016, 651 unaccompanied minors were placed in Nassau County, which is home to one of the largest growing   gang population’s in the U. S. In neighboring Suffolk County, which has a widespread   gang problem in Brentwood and Central Islip, approximately 915 have been resettled in the region.

193,Imagining Daddy: A rig worker’s daughter and her dreams,2015-04-10," (CNN) Lacy Anderson cries at night and calls out for her mother. Tell me about the day you and Dad got married. How did Dad react the day I was born? Tell the story about when Dad proposed to you. Lacy was 5 when her father, Jason Anderson, died. He was 35 years old, one of 11 men killed when Deepwater Horizon exploded in the Gulf of Mexico on April 20, 2010. In the weeks and months immediately after her dad’s death, the little girl would hug her crying mother. ”It’s OK,” she told her mom. ”Daddy’s in heaven now.” It’s mom who does the comforting now. ”She always wants me to tell her stories about her daddy,” Shelley Anderson says.  Now 10, Lacy watches in awe the video of her mom and dad’s wedding day on July 27, 2002, when more than 1, 000 people overflowed the pews at First Baptist Church in Bay City, Texas. She relishes her role as big sister. She tries to preserve the memory of Dad for her brother Ryver, who was just over 1 when their father was killed.  Lacy tells    Ryver about the way Daddy lost his fingers. He was fighting with his big sister over a bicycle when he was a boy, not much older than Ryver now. Big Sis pedaled off and he grabbed the chain, slicing off two fingertips. Doctors stitched one back on grandpa told them to sew it on his right index finger so he could hunt. The lesson there may be to always listen to your big sister. Other times, Lacy retells the story of when Daddy proposed. He’d been cleaning guns and had them scattered all over the living room. Friends were coming over for a barbecue. He and mom gathered up the guns and put them in the gun closet. He handed her a bag from a jewelry store. ”Do you want this?” Jason said.   Not exactly romantic, but that’s the way Daddy was. He sure loved Mom. It might be cliché to say a boy is the spitting image of his father, but that is the truth in this case. Put a picture of a young Jason next to one of Ryver and it’s nearly impossible to distinguish the two.   Ryver has piercing blue eyes and straight, reddish blond hair. The same woman who cut Jason’s hair cuts his boy’s. Ryver has the same crooked smile and can raise a quizzical eyebrow, just like his father.   Too young to remember anything about his dad, Ryver loves hearing stories. A favorite is about the time his father and mother floated on an inner tube down the Guadalupe River. Ryver was a souvenir from that trip, and so got his name. Shelley stays busy rearing two children by herself. ”I hope I’m doing OK,” she says.  Ryver is active in   and Lacy gets tutored an hour away once a week. In the fall, she will cheerlead. They are surrounded by family and friends who pitch in on a moment’s notice, ”but I think I’ve just learned in a different way,” Shelley says. ”It’s life, but not the life we planned.” Jason prepared her well. On his last trip home, he made sure she knew how to charge the batteries to their motor home. He went over the combination of the family’s safe and wanted her to memorize it. He taught her other ”man stuff,” too. On the way to the airport, he went over his will.   Shelley didn’t know it at the time, but Jason had confided in his father that Deepwater Horizon was having major problems and he felt ”it was going to get somebody killed.” Her grief has been insufferable. At one point, her blood pressure skyrocketed. But she bears no ill will toward those in charge of Deepwater. Harboring hatred, she says, would do no good. ”It doesn’t make you feel better,” she says, ”and the people you’re hating, they don’t care.” The family home in Midfield, Texas, was being renovated when Jason was killed. It has since been completed, and breathes of life with a young family. But his absence is omnipresent. Out back, his   remains unfinished. Shelley keeps his wedding band on a charm bracelet and runs her finger through it when she wants to feel his presence. When she longs to hear his deep baritone, she calls his cell phone and listens to the message. ”. ..I’ll get back to ya. ..” ”I call it all the time,” she says. On spring break, she took her two children to Houston to visit a memorial statue outside the offices of Transocean, which employed nine of the 11 men who died. Stopping there has become a family tradition. The  children place flowers in water at the base of the statue.   The rest of the Gulf may have returned to living their lives, Shelley says, and that’s fine by her. She understands. She places her hand on her heart: ”Jason’s memory is here.” Mother: ’I feel like I’m losing more of him’ When BP commercials come on TV advertising a   Gulf of Mexico, Arleen Weise reaches for her clicker. She presses the mute button. She suppresses her anger. ”I just want to throw something at my TV,” she says. Arleen’s    son, Adam, was the second youngest to die on the rig    and the only one who was not a father.  Immediately after the accident, Arleen moved into her son’s home, a   in Yorktown, Texas, filled with hunting trophies. Adam lived for his     and his mother dutifully kept it up.   His Redwing boots stood next to the back door. Mom placed plants inside to keep life sprouting.   But as the years passed, Arleen could no longer make the   commute to and from work. She sold her son’s home about 1½ years ago and moved to Victoria, where she cuts hair. The   and its giant mud tires became too hard to maintain. She sold it to a young man she hoped would enjoy ”The Big Nasty” as much as her youngest son he was killed in a shooting accident months later.  A neighborhood dog walked off with one of her son’s boots and chewed it up. She never recovered it. ”Every time I turn around,” Arleen says, ”I feel like I’m losing more of him.” She clings to memories of her   son. He would hide in the bushes at the local golf club and blow an air horn when golfers hit midswing. When he was a boy, she kissed him on the school bus in front of his classmates. ”That’s OK,” Adam said when they teased him, ”because I love my momma.” ”When I think of him, it’s a good memory,” she says. ”He was such a sensitive, good kid, and so sweet all the time. . .. Sometimes, it’s overwhelming and you cry. Sometimes, you just gotta laugh.” Adam and his grandfather were especially close. His granddad died in October 2008. ”I’m at peace where my son is,” she says. ”He’s up with my dad.”  On the first anniversary, she and other families were flown by helicopter to the site of the disaster. On the way out, the group    a mix of widows and bereaved mothers and fathers    exchanged small talk. Then, the chopper circled over where their loved ones perished.   There wasn’t much to see, except for open water.  ”It was a very quiet ride back.”   There are no big plans to mark the fifth anniversary. Arleen will be taking a friend to get eye surgery in Austin, a distraction to keep her mind off the tragedy. ”I’ve lived that day many times over,” she says. ”There’s no need to sit around and feel sorry for myself.” Arleen is a hair stylist at Hair by Dianne and Company in Victoria, where she’s worked since 2008. Her sister made a wreath out of Adam’s favorite red plaid shirt.   It hangs on her door at work, where ”I can see it all the time. You know, just look at it.” In her new home, she has kept a shrine to Adam in one room: his pool table remains surrounded by deer heads, rattlesnake skins and bobcats.  Her mother, Nelda Winslette, recently celebrated her 81st birthday. The two drove over to Louisiana to meet with a woman working on a memorial in Port Fourchon to honor the 11 rig workers. Arleen and her mom lived it up, hitting a casino and feasting on crawfish. Arleen’s mom knows the details of what happened. Yet, perhaps because no remains were found, the grandmother often looks toward the door. ”I just keep waiting for that boy to walk through,” Adam’s grandma says. ”It’s not going to happen, Mom,” Arleen responds. Arleen keeps pressing on. The best way to honor her son, she believes, is to be a positive person and to love life. ”I try to be as good as he was . ..” She pauses and searches for the right words. Instead, she leaves it at that. The baseball player who pitched for his dad, Treavor Curtis spied home plate with his deep blue eyes. When he kicked his leg up and unleashed his fastball, it was a thing of beauty. Unhittable when he was in a groove.   Few people beyond his teammates knew what he was playing for. On the inside of his baseball cap the boy had written: ”In honor of Dad.” The Bulldogs of Georgetown High in Louisiana rode the strong arm of their ace to the state playoffs his junior season, just a year after the rig explosion.  Those who’d been around long enough swore the    kid with jet black hair and a nasty heater was a spitting image of his father, Stephen Ray Curtis, a standout for the Bulldogs in his day. The only difference: the father was a southpaw.  Awesome.   That’s the way they still talk about Treavor on the mound. His fastball topped 85 mph, and he mixed it up with curveballs and a nice breaking ball.   But every pitch, every game, the absence of his father loomed. Maybe it motivated him to do better. To dig deeper. To make his father proud.   ”He could’ve quit everything, but he chose to play harder,” says Sheila Reeder, who helped coach the team. ”He was determined to be the best.” For his mother, Sissy Curtis, it was a thrill to watch. If she ever brought up his father, Treavor would hide his feelings. ”Do you want to talk to me about it?” she would ask. ”Nope.” Treavor was 14 and a sophomore in high school on April 20, 2010. Mom cut short her mail route that day when she heard something had happened on Deepwater Horizon. When she saw TV reports, her gut just knew. She called the school secretary and asked if the older kids were talking about the explosion. Yes, the mom was told. She rushed to school and fetched Treavor. She sat her boy down. She had done the same a couple years before when Treavor’s uncle, Stephen’s brother, was killed in a wreck.   ”It was like I was reliving it all over again,” she says. ”I told him there’s been an explosion on his dad’s rig.” The boy maintained hope. Sissy was divorced from Stephen, who lived right up the road. Treavor kept riding his   back and forth between the homes.  He drove up on his   shortly after authorities called off the search for the 11 missing men.  ”It was horrible. Horrible,” his mom says.  The days, weeks and years since then    there’s no other way to put it    have been rough.   Beyond baseball, father and son loved deer season and turkey hunting. The boy who grew into a man had to do it all without his dad.  At low points, he’d scream at his mom for their divorce: ”Why didn’t you love my daddy?” ”I did love your daddy,” she told him. ”We just grew apart.” She saved press clippings about his father and news reports explaining what went wrong on the rig. She keeps them tucked in a special spot at her home. ”One day he might want to know.” Treavor, now 19, declined to be interviewed. ”He doesn’t like to discuss it,” his mom says of the explosion. She believes ”it’s something that could’ve been prevented. They knew what was taking place. They should’ve got those men off the rig.” Treavor was one of 21 children to lose their fathers that day one, born three weeks after the accident, never met his father. Confidential financial settlements have been reached over the years with families of those killed. A lawyer representing Treavor says he is believed to be the only one not compensated, the result of his parents being divorced and his father remarrying. ”Treavor kind of fell between the cracks,” says attorney John W. Stevenson Jr.  A wrongful death claim remains pending. ”I grieve because of my son,” Sissy says. ”They say, ’If you have children, you hurt because they hurt.’ It’s very true.”  Treavor missed having his father in the stands for his ball games. Beside him on deer hunts. At his high school graduation.   At times late at night, the boy dreams of his father returning home.   ”I feel like that’s the way his dad is sending him messages or talking to him,” Sissy says. She tells Treavor to cherish those dreams. To speak to his father."
194,George Lopez: I’ll Give Trump a Chance... to ’Suck My Ass’,2016-11-14,"Comedian George Lopez may be one of the few celebrities who could acutally keep his promise to leave the United States following Donald Trump’s historic presidential election victory earlier this month. [During an encounter with TMZ on Sunday at Los Angeles International Airport, the comedian was asked whether he would give Trump a “chance,” as his fellow comedian Dave Chappelle suggested he would do while hosting Saturday Night Live this week.  “I’ll give him a chance to suck my ass,” Lopez replied.  Last year Lopez became one of the first celebrities to threaten to leave the country if Trump won the election. “If he wins, he won’t have to worry about immigration. We’ll all go back,” the Latino comedian and TV star told TMZ just weeks after Trump announced his presidential bid. On Sunday, Lopez hinted that he may already have set plans in motion to leave the country following Trump’s victory Tuesday night. “Listen, I’m in escrow. Don’t worry about my residential status,” he told the outlet. “And I’m not going to tell you where I’m going to go, it’ll drive up real estate prices. Because in a f*cking year, nobody’s going to want to be here. ” Lopez also joked that he had stopped eating the snack food Cheetos: “Anything orange I don’t want,” he said. In April, Lopez endorsed former Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders but said he feared he could not support the Vermont Senator’s tax proposal. “I endorsed Bernie Sanders, but really just to  …     I mean, it’s cool,” Lopez said on BigBoyTV. “I can’t pay any more taxes it’s ridiculous. But, so, we’ll figure it out. I really just did it to get the awareness out and have people vote. ”   Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter @jeromeehudson"

196,Pence kicks off busy summer with Iowa stop,2017-06-03,"Washington (CNN) Motorcycles, cornfields, pork roast and, of course, politics.  Vice President Mike Pence kicked off his summer campaign schedule Saturday by appearing at Sen. Joni Ernst’s Roast and Ride fundraiser, his debut into a season his advisers believe will be very busy as he helps Republicans raise money and lends a hand to GOP candidates. His aides vehemently brush away any talk of a 2020 presidential bid. But Pence    who is significantly less unpopular than President Donald Trump    is a natural on the stump and delivers a disciplined message, even repeating large sections of his stump speech from the campaign trail on Saturday in Iowa.  At the event in Boone, Iowa, Pence arrived riding a motorcycle, donning a white helmet and wearing blue jeans. ”I just couldn’t have been more proud this week to be standing with the President, who chose to put American workers and American jobs first, who chose to put American energy and American industry first,” Pence said. ”I want to submit to you by withdrawing from the Paris climate accord, President Donald Trump chose to put the forgotten men and women of America first, and he always will.” Next, the vice president is slated to keynote a National Republican Congressional Dinner next week in Washington. He’ll also appear at a Republican National Committee event in Chicago midsummer and he’ll be doing ”several events” with the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said a senior Pence adviser. Pence is no stranger to hitting the road in his official capacity as vice president. Four weekends in a row in the spring, he was burning rubber as he visited Trump campaign strongholds like West Virginia and Ohio. Several of those weekends, the President hung back in Washington and Florida, visiting his Trump golf courses. The senior Pence adviser said Iowa    the     caucus state in the presidential primary calendard    was a natural invitation to accept when Ernst asked him to join her at her annual Roast and Ride event. ”It’s certainly a pivotal state and one that we’ve partnered with their leaders on lots of things,” the adviser said. The Trump administration viewed the state’s other Republican senator, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, as a major ally in the Neil Gorsuch Supreme Court confirmation process. Ernst has been ”a partner on several things,” the adviser said, and former Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad is Trump’s pick as ambassador to China. ”This is the point when the energy starts to pick up,” the adviser added. The requests have been pouring in for appearances by the vice president, according to his team, but his advisers aim for quality over quantity.  ”Where will he have an impact?” one longtime adviser asked. The answer, Pence’s team thinks, will be in competitive races, such as Georgia’s special election, where Republican Karen Handel is facing a heated runoff contest with Democrat Jon Ossoff. Also expect Pence to be out campaigning with the Republican Virginia gubernatorial candidate, a race that’s already gaining national attention. ”We don’t want to wait until next spring to weigh in on the midterms,” another longtime adviser to Pence said. This person described an effort to build a ”war chest” now so that there are ample funds to carry them into 2018. Pence polls significantly better than the President. In a   poll taken near the end of Trump’s first 100 days in office, Pence was polling at a slightly higher favorability than the President    46% versus 44%    but his unfavorability was significantly lower: 39% to the President’s 54%. In his capacity as vice President, Pence will still promote the Trump administration’s agenda, a spokesman said, selling its tax reform plan and attending town halls.  ”It’s a great way for the vice president to support the President in a deliberate way,” one adviser said. Or, as one of Pence’s longtime advisers put it: ”What’s good for the President is good for us.” But, the adviser then added, ”It’s never a bad idea to build relationships.”"

198,Donald Trump: ’The Haters Are Going Crazy’,2017-02-07,"President Donald Trump reacted to the ongoing hysteria from the media and the left about his relationship with Vladimir Putin after he again declined to denounce the Russian president in an interview with Bill O’Reilly. [“I don’t know Putin, have no deals in Russia, and the haters are going crazy  —   yet Obama can make a deal with Iran, #1 in terror, no problem!” Trump wrote on Twitter on Tuesday morning.  During the Fox News interview before the Super Bowl, Trump said that he had “respect” for Putin. “Well, I respect a lot of people, but that doesn’t mean I’m going to get along with him. He’s a leader of his country,” he said. “I say it’s better to get along with Russia than not. ” O’Reilly repeatedly called Putin “a killer,” suggesting to Trump that he should distance himself. “There are a lot of killers. We’ve got a lot of killers,” Trump replied, citing the Iraq War. “What do you think  —   our country’s so innocent? You think our country’s so innocent?”"
199,"Man sues police, says face smashed into cruiser windshield",2016-10-01," (CNN) Pele Smith is suing the Lorain Police Department in Ohio, alleging use of excessive force after an encounter with an officer in 2014 ended with his face getting smashed into a cruiser windshield so hard the glass broke.  Dashboard camera footage from Lorain police released this week shows an officer leading Smith to a police cruiser. The    was detained on suspicion of jaywalking and potential possession of drugs, Lorain police said.  In the video, as Smith gets closer to the vehicle, his body abruptly shifts paths, and his face is slammed into the front windshield. The officer is out of the camera’s view right before Smith’s face meets the windshield.  ”I know it doesn’t look good,” Lorain Police Capt. Roger Watkins said. ”But our intention wasn’t for him to hit the windshield.” Smith filed the lawsuit in August, nearly two years after the incident.  The police department has denied the allegations in Smith’s lawsuit, according to a statement from Lorain Police Chief Cel Rivera. Rivera released a statement Thursday after the video was made public, stating it ”does not tell the complete story.” On September 4, 2014, police were patrolling near Palm Elementary School after the narcotics bureau received a drug complaint, according to a police report. Lorain police Detective Timothy Thompson spotted Smith crossing the street toward the school and stopped him, according to the report. Thompson was familiar with Smith from ”several past encounters,” including drug complaints, he wrote in the report.  After stopping him, Thompson saw Smith swallow an item he was holding in his hand    what officers believed could be a bag of heroin or cocaine, the report said. The officers handcuffed Smith after he swallowed the substance.  Officer Zachary Ferenec then arrived and escorted Smith to his cruiser. Right before Ferenec reached the cruiser, Smith’s face hit the windshield.   ”Smith began pushing against me with his body,” Ferenec said in the police report, describing the struggle between the two.  As the two got closer to the car, Ferenec wrote, ”Smith made an abrupt push against me increasing his resistance. I pushed forward to counter his quick forceful pressure.”  The entire encounter takes 6 seconds in the video    from Smith starting to walk toward the cruiser led by Ferenec to his head meeting the glass.  ”My client denies ever becoming combative with the officers,” said Mark Petroff, Smith’s attorney in the lawsuit.  Smith was taken to Mercy Regional Medical Center in Lorain to have his stomach pumped for drugs the officers believed he had swallowed, according to the police report.  Petroff said the officers did not find any drugs on him, aside from Excedrin. The doctors didn’t pump Smith’s stomach because too much time had passed when he reached the hospital, but drugs were never reported to have been found in his system.  Watkins, the police captain, told CNN that Smith was taken to the hospital not only to have his stomach pumped but also to be treated for injuries after hitting the windshield.  In the police report, Thompson, the detective, said, ”Smith was transported . .. due to him swallowing illegal narcotics.” There was no mention of a concern for his injuries in the report.    Smith was charged with obstructing official business, tampering with evidence and resisting arrest. No drug possession charges were filed then.  Smith is being held at the Community Based Correctional Facility in Ohio after he was arrested and charged with trafficking heroin in May, according to the Lorain Municipal Court criminal clerk’s office.

200,’Jurassic World’: Should you see it?,2015-06-12," (CNN) Well, at least the dinosaurs are cool. ”Jurassic World” is in theaters today, and although there is plenty of talk about the impressive special effects    with the massive prehistoric creatures inhabiting an island resort with the most interesting type of   (that sounds nicer than ”theme park”)    some critics seemed less than impressed with stars Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard. Even director Colin Trevorrow and executive producer Steven Spielberg take a few swipes. That’s not to say everyone hated it. But the hugs doled out for the film seemed to come from the tiny arms of a T. Rex more than from the massive wings of a Quetzalcoatlus.  The New York Times’  Manohla Dargis wrote, ”In reality, there’s more flab than muscle packed on this galumphing franchise reboot, which, as it lumbers from scene to scene, reminds you of what a great action god Steven Spielberg is. Too bad he didn’t take the reins on this.” ”Actors repeat their bad lines without smirking, and digital dinosaurs stomp, scatter and gulp amid product placements for Triumph motorcycles and Jimmy Buffett’s Margaritaville chain,” Dargis wrote. ”There are so many plugs for Mercedes that you may wonder if the targeted viewers are studio executives.” Here’s what some other critics had to say: Chris Nashawaty, Entertainment Weekly, ”We want to see our dinosaurs rampaging fast and furious over and over. In that sense, Jurassic World is a blockbuster of its moment. It’s not deep. There aren’t new lessons to be learned. And the film’s    actors are basically glamorized extras. But when it comes to serving up a smorgasbord of bloody dino mayhem, it accomplishes exactly what it sets out to do beautifully.” Peter Hammond, Deadline: ”So is the movie all that? The effects of course are tremendous and I had a great time. It doesn’t break new ground in this genre but it’s just plain   fun. And like last year’s reboot of ’Godzilla,’ this one smartly makes the main attraction monster vs. monster    or in this case, dino vs. dino    action.” Todd McCarthy, The Hollywood Reporter: ”Despite the story’s formulaic structure and the predictable nature of its cautionary stance on playing God, the   Saturday   pleasures stemming from resourceful   in the face of mighty odds retain an appeal    if done reasonably well    which is the case here. The action only occasionally rises to rousing, and the romance, such as it is, between the   Indiana Jones type appealingly played by Pratt and the corporate mouthpiece less engagingly embodied by Howard, never gets off the ground.” Fiore Mastracci, Moviepilot. com  ”All in all, ’Jurassic World’ brings the series back to where it belongs. You can watch the first one, skip the second and third, and jump straight to this one and have a better franchise. The movie is filled with dinosaurs and dinosaur action. It’s worth repeated views and deserves a spot on your home video shelf.” Marlow Stern, The Daily Beast, ”Because of all these dazzling   attributes, people    myself including    will enter the theater wanting to like it craving a Proustian flashback to the childlike wonderment you felt seeing that giant, roaring T. rex stomping after   Jeff Goldblum in a Jeep for the first time. But ’Jurassic World’ is not good. In fact, it’s aggressively bad.”"
201,Dad hilariously re-creates daughter’s sexy selfies,2016-06-30," (CNN)”You’re so hot!” Like most fathers would be, Chris ”Burr” Martin was taken aback when he saw that comment posted in response to one of his    daughter Cassie’s sexy selfies on her Instagram account. Instead of telling her to stop posting the photos or giving her a lengthy lecture, the Spokane,   comedian creatively decided to take some selfies of his own. ”I did it because she posted something and the guys in the comment section were too much,” Martin said. ”So to put water on the fire, I posted one like it and said, ’What about me, guys?’ and that did it.” Martin has   five of Cassie’s selfies and proudly posted them to his Instagram account. Yes, the   ”selfie dad” has even mastered the duck face. He now has more than 16, 000 followers on Instagram. How did Cassie react? ”She rolled her eyes at first, but once she saw her friends thought it was funny, she was OK with it,” Martin said. ”I enjoy making people laugh.”  Martin is just one of many fathers in the United States who have used humor as a part of parenting and have drawn lots of attention while doing it. In 2013, Utah dad Scott Mackintosh wore   shorts in a photo posted online when he didn’t want his daughter Myley to wear shorts shorter than what he approved of. Just like Cassie, Myley couldn’t help but chuckle. ”My dad’s humor has always been twisted in with his parenting,” Cassie said. ”I think some parents should tie in some comedy with their opinions on certain life choices their kids make, but understand your child first before doing it. Different families have different ways to express their voices.”"
202,"Pamela Geller: In the Year Since the First Islamic State Attack on American Soil, These Muslims Confirmed ’the War Has Just Begun’ - Breitbart",2016-05-03,"Today is the first anniversary of the Islamic State’s first attack in the homeland. [Just a couple of short months later, in response to the Chattanooga jihadi who slaughtered four Marines, one Navy officer said: “The War Has Just Begun. More to Come. ”  He was right. Yet one year after jihadis attacked our Muhammad Art Exhibit and Cartoon Contest in defense of free speech, the West is in full surrender mode. In the wake of the Garland jihad attacks, the world says: let the bullies silence you. Don’t draw Muhammad. Comply with their other demands. Garland changed everything for my colleagues and me. Its personal toll has been enormous. It has affected our lives and our careers in innumerable ways, all of them negative. Our security costs are now astronomical. We cannot step outside without remembering that we are hunted, and at any time jihadis could strike at us. We went into the event with our eyes open. We knew the risks. But we knew the risks were greater, for our children and our children’s children, if we allowed the freedom of speech to be destroyed by violent intimidation. Yet still we were cast as the villains. An imam told Sean Hannity that I should be executed.   media and political figures agreed with him that in standing for free speech, I had provoked the jihadis. Fox News host Martha McCallum pleaded with me to respect Islam and constrain myself. Bill O’Reilly said I “spurred” the violence. Erin Burnett accused me of “relishing” being targeted for beheading. Alisyn Camerota on CNN battled with me, trying to bully me into adhering to sharia law. Chris Cuomo was almost brought to tears by the thought of drawing Muhammad. Juan Williams and I had a   drag out on Hannity. Geraldo Rivera compared me to the Aryan Nation, skinheads, and the KKK, and said, “Every time I see her on TV, I want to take a shower. ” Carly Fiorina likened our free speech event to white supremacist marching. Donald Trump said I was an obnoxious blowhard (!) who was taunting Muslims. The list is long. The leftist networks (i. e. MSNBC) were unhinged. I could go on, but you get the picture. One year on, jihad in America is raging. We were right. Gerard Perry wrote an excellent essay on the “shortsightedness of the media lynch mob. ” But still people are afraid to have me speak. CPAC refused to allow me to host an event. Ironically, Donald Trump is suffering the same abuse I received from him, for speaking candidly about jihad terror and Muslim immigration. What have we learned since Garland? Nothing. But here is what we know and what the media does not deign to cover, as they are too consumed with destroying the GOP and its presidential candidates. The mediasphere is devoid of actual news now. Authorities investigated whether the San Bernardino jihad killers had been in touch with an alleged ISIS operative from Minnesota, just as one of the jihadis did before the Garland free speech shooting. The Muslim mastermind in the Garland jihad attack was indeed tied to ISIS. This represents an epic intel failure. That mastermind was convicted of conspiring to support ISIS in an Arizona trial. The FBI disclosed that a jihadi at our free speech event messaged multiple foreign Muslim fighters. These were devout, observant Muslims. A former roommate of the Garland jihadis said they regularly participated in Friday prayers at their mosque, and wanted “to blow up nonbelievers. ” He also said that they regular went target shooting after Friday prayers. But the FBI is bound as a matter of policy to ignore things like that. The FBI failed to heed public warnings of jihadi plans to hit our free speech event. More came out recently in the trial of the Boston Muslims who plotted to behead me last summer, after ISIS put a fatwa on my head. Even while awaiting trial, these jihadis tried to organize beheadings from jail. Prosecutors revealed that an ISIS ebook helped inspire the attack on me. A   ISIS operative instructed American Muslims to kill me. An informant in the case on the jihad attack in Garland said there were 50 to 80 more Muslim terrorists out there, ready to strike. And yet TIME magazine lamented that Muhammad cartoons make Muslims “feel less safe. ” The Garland jihad was followed by a spate of   attacks on American soil. Here is a list of the acts of jihad in the US since the Garland, Texas jihad shooting. It is only the US  —   mind you, the Muslim invasion of Europe and its attendant violence, brutality, and supremacism is not included. This is just in the USA since Garland, May 3, 2015. I was stunned assembling this list. Even me, and I have been covering jihad activity    for the past 13 years. I am stunned that we are more cowed than ever. Stunned that my colleagues and I are still blacklisted, shunned, and demonized. Stunned that hate groups such as the SPLC and   groups like CAIR and ISNA are given the imprimatur of legitimacy by the media and academic elites. Stunned, in light of the rivers of blood. Since the Garland jihad plot: In the Boston beheading plot, charges include material support for the Islamic State. Feds arrested a fifth man in connection with a group of Brooklyn ISIS sympathizers who were charged with plotting to join the jihad group and attack the United States. A Virginia Muslim teen pleaded guilty to helping ISIS. Florida Muslims faced prison for a jihad mass murder bomb plot in New York City.  A Rhode Islam Muslim was tied to the Boston beheading plot.

In New York, a Muslim pizza shop owner was charged and later convicted for recruiting for the Islamic state. In Washington, DC, a Muslim was charged with funding and recruiting for the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan. US authorities sought to revoke the citizenship of an Oregon imam accused of “dealing directly” with Osama bin Laden.  The director of the FBI warned that the Islamic State was recruiting in all 50 states. A Florida Muslim was arrested for an alleged WMD plot to bomb a Florida beach. Authorities say he expressed a desire to “cook American[s]   …     in cages” and also boasted: “We will destroy America” and “We will raise our black flag on top of your White House. ” A New York Muslim  —   who police say threatened to behead his daughter in 2013  —   was charged with aiding ISIS and recruiting for it. A witness told the FBI that he argued ISIS’s murders of Muslims were justified because “the victims were not Muslims. ” A New Jersey Muslim was arrested for allegedly organizing a “small army” of ISIS fighters in New York and New Jersey. Two Mississippi Muslims were charged with trying to join ISIS. The FBI issued an alert about “  males” who were approaching the family members of US military personnel. A Florida Muslim who plotted a WMD attack on a beach had been cleared to work at the Key West airport, in a job that gave him direct access to secure areas. A Mississippi Muslim allegedly threatened to kill   hospital staff after issuing a series of bomb threats. A US Muslim teen was jailed for more than 11 years for waging jihad with the Islamic State. An Arizona Muslim was charged with supporting ISIS. ISIS posted a list of 1, 400 U. S. “targets”: “soon with the permission of Allah will strike at your necks in your own lands!” A California Muslim pleaded guilty to trying to join ISIS.  ISIS claimed responsibility for a shooting at Umpqua College. In New Jersey, a Muslim teen who supported ISIS was charged in a plot targeting the   Memorial.  Several Minnesota Muslims pleaded guilty to joining ISIS. An   Muslim was arrested in New York City. He said: “I’m ready to die for the Caliphate. ” The FBI foiled an Islamic plot to kill the Pope during his US visit. ISIS threatened US colleges: “We are coming. ” At Union Station in Washington, DC, a   man slashed a woman and charged at a police officer. Robert Spencer suggested that his name indicated an Islamic conversion. Muslim students at the University of   Cities (UMN) rejected a Moment of Recognition Resolution for   saying it was “Islamophobic. ” An   Muslim in Ohio is charged with plotting to kill US soldiers and bomb churches and schools, allegedly posting online: “Behead them in their own homes. ”’ The FBI revealed that it had 900 ongoing   investigations. Faisal Mohammad, a Muslim student at the University of California Merced, went on a stabbing spree, smiling as he slashed at his victims. Law enforcement officials said he was on a terror watch list, and the university was warned of the threat he posed, but nothing was done to stop him. Only many months later did the FBI finally admit that he was inspired by the Islamic State. An NYPD undercover officer foiled a jihad bomb plot in New York City. An   engineer at a US defense contractor was given an   sentence for giving details about US jets to Iran. A Muslim who plotted to build a   training camp in Oregon was also sentenced. The US charged an American Muslim with helping an Al   group. In San Bernardino, two Muslims carried out a mass jihad shooting at a Christmas party, murdering 14 people. Before carrying out that jihad massacre, the San Bernardino jihad gunman had visited 11 school cafeterias. The San Bernardino jihadis pledged allegiance to ISIS during their attack. Nonetheless, the Obama Administration nixed a probe into the San Bernardino jihadists, who had practiced for their attack a year in advance. San Bernardino killer Syed Rizwan Farook discussed carrying out a jihad attack three years ago. A Muslim neighbor now faces federal charges for providing the San Bernardino jihadis with guns. Three relatives of the jihad killers were later arrested. In Minnesota, a Muslim refugee from Somalia was arrested for allegedly aiding ISIS. In California, a Muslim reportedly brandished a sword and chased down a neighbor while screaming, “I would die and kill for Allah. ” In Philadelphia, a Muslim stands accused of shooting a police officer thirteen times.

In Columbus, Ohio, a Muslim named Muhammad Barry slashed at patrons in a restaurant owned by a proudly   Israeli Christian. In Washington, a Muslim prisoner allegedly screamed “Allahu akbar” and tried to kill a corrections officer. An Washington Muslim was arrested on charges of supporting ISIS. He allegedly said: “I feel the duty to kill” U. S. servicemen and stand accused of plotting to attack a military base. A Michigan Muslim, 22, was arrested for “planning to shoot up a church to support ISIS. ” FBI documents quote him as saying: “It is my dream to behead someone. ” A Kansas Muslim vowed to “bring the Islamic State straight to your doorstep” with a 1, 000 pound bomb. A North Carolina ISIS terrorist was indicted for allegedly killing his neighbor and asking an FBI agent to kill his parents, as part of an alleged jihad plot to kill 1, 000 people. A Florida Muslim leader referred to Jews as “pigs” and “monkeys. ” This kind of language incites Muslims to violence. The FBI thwarted a mass shooting at a Milwaukee Masonic temple allegedly plottedby a devout Muslim. He reportedly said: “We are Muslims defending the Muslim religion. ” A Muslim veteran of the US Air Force was found guilty of trying to join ISIS. ISIS issued a kill list of Air Force, FBI, and military personnel, along with government officials, commanding Muslims to “slay them wherever you find them. ” In New York City, a Muslim man with a long rap sheet allegedly ambushed and fired upon eight NYPD cops, injuring two officers. A Muslim who had been in contact with ISIS was charged with threatening to blow up a Walgreens in a Minneapolis suburb.

The ISIS United Cyber Caliphate posted 3, 600 NY residents’ names and addresses, saying: “We Want Them #Dead” A Michigan church website was defaced with an ominous jihadi message from ISIS. The result of this epidemic of jihad attacks? Obama’s dawah speech about how “Islam is Peace” is repeated weekly, sometimes daily now. What have we learned? Are mosques being monitored? All of these jihadis regularly worshiped at mosques. What is being taught at these mosques? Are investigators simply going to assume that these mosques are “moderate” and that the jihadis are “radicalized” elsewhere? If that is true, why couldn’t the peaceful teachings they heard at the mosque withstand the appeal of the “radicals”? Right now, nothing is being done to stop jihad recruiting in U. S. mosques, even as several hundred young Muslims from the U. S. have gone to wage jihad for the Islamic State and are now waging jihad here. U. S. law enforcement officials must take it upon themselves to learn about what Islam and jihad are really all about, then strategize accordingly about how to stop it. The mosques must be monitored. Muslim immigration must stop. All over the world, the brutal sharia is being imposed on   and free thinkers. Bangladesh is awash in the blood of free thinkers, poets, secularists, and  . The slaughter there is daily now. Devout Muslims tried to kill us in Garland one year ago today for the same reason: perceived insults to Muhammad  —   in other words, violation of Islamic law. Under Islamic law, just a whisper that you offended or criticized Muhammad, and you are marked for death. It’s just that simple. The world is looking away, just as it did during the rise of the Third Reich. Deaf, dumb, blind is the world to the extermination of millions in jihad wars. There is no excuse now. Echoing Dr. Ernst Janning from Judgment at Nuremberg, no one can pretend not to know. There are websites  —   mine, Jihad Watch, The Religion of Peace, et al. “We didn’t know” won’t fly. The world was guilty then, and the world is guilty now. Then, the world said, “take Sudetenland. Take the Rhineland, Take Austria. Take Czechoslovakia. ” And now, the world says, take Syria. Take Gaza, Take Judea, Samaria, Lebanon, the Ivory Coast, Libya  …     The world says, “Islam is peace. ” The world says, “It’s not millions of victims, it’s hundreds. ” That’s a blatant lie, but what difference does that make? We stand for justice, truth, and the value of a single human.

203,"Yes, that’s J. Peterman from ’Seinfeld’ pitching an IPO on TV — no, that’s not the most surprising thing about it",2017-05-12,"’  ’ ’   ”Ever heard of Uber or Lyft?” ’ ”   The man on TV has   gray hair and looks directly into   the camera. Behind him, there’s a false backdrop of trading   screens and skyscrapers. It’s an ad running on CNBC and Fox News   for something called YayYo. ” ’   ”Yes, YayYo,” the man says. The  isn’’t for its   app. It’’s for an . ’ ’   The man looks familiar, but his pitch is unusual. ’ ’   You could make millions, like the early investors in Uber, he   suggests. ”Do it now. Before all the shares are gone.” ’ ’   Watching these ads, two questions come to mind: ’ ’   The answer to both is yes. The actor’’s name is John O’’Hurley. How   it’’s possible that he’’s pitching shares in a risky startup on TV   is more complicated. Even though the IPO is ”qualified” by the   Securities and Exchange Commission, the aggressive way YayYo   shares are being marketed could be problematic, experts say,   especially since the pitch is to    investors. ’ ’  ’ ’   The company is a tiny startup with no working product, few   staffers, but a big marketing budget. YayYo says it wants to be   the Kayak of the   industry, allowing you to compare   prices and book rides on Uber, Lyft, and other such companies in   a single app. ’ ’   At the center of it all is Ramy   whose life before   starting YayYo involved working with an arms dealer, promoting   ”Men Are from Mars, Women Are From Venus,” and led ultimately to   accusations of a   scheme and one of the   biggest securities bailouts in history. ’ ’     never admitted wrongdoing but was barred from running   a public company for five years, a steep comedown for a man who   once proudly rubbed shoulders with the likes of Hugh Hefner,   Ivanka Trump, and royalty as he sought to amass a fortune. ’ ’     is pitching investors on the YayYo IPO thanks to the   2012 Jumpstart our Business Startups, or JOBS . Meant to   spur investment in smaller companies, it also allowed companies   to pitch their IPOs on TV for the first time and created a new   kind of   whereby entrepreneurs can raise up to $50   million from just about anyone. ’ ’  ’ ’   ”If you would  —   write this in a positive way,”   said in   the third of a series of interviews with Business Insider,   concerned about being portrayed negatively. He spoke with   reporters over the phone and in person at his Beverly Hills   office. ’ ’   In those conversations, Batrawi said YayYo has big plans. In   addition to its aggregator app, YayYo says it is gearing up to   launch its own    with a fleet of luxury cars   and salaried drivers behind the wheel. ’ ’   ”We are moving along in pretty good shape,” he said. ’ ”   But while YayYo aggressively solicits investors on TV, the   company’s products are far from ready, and some of his claims   don’t seem to stand up. ” ”   Launching the aggregator service is dependent on securing   agreements with companies such as Uber and Lyft so that it can   integrate those services’ prices and available cars into the   YayYo app. ” ’     said in one conversation that those deals were on the   way. YayYo is in ”contact” with Uber and it has an ”agreement”   with Lyft, he said. ’ ’   Uber and Lyft deny this. ’ ’   ”We sent YayYo a    letter several weeks ago and   have suspended their access to Lyft,” Adrian Durbin, a Lyft   spokesman, told Business Insider. ”I think it’’s fair to say that   their CEO’’s characterization of our relationship is wildly   inaccurate.” ’ ’   Uber has no deal of any kind with YayYo, according to Kaitlin   Durkosh, a spokeswoman for Uber. ’ ’   Later,   said the company never got Lyft’’s      order, and Bob Vanech, a YayYo board member,   said it has some ”clever strategies” to deal with the fact that   Uber and Lyft are denying companies like YayYo access to their   information. YayYo plans to partner with   companies   ”three through 100,” he said. ’ ’   YayYo said it is planning a beta in the next couple of weeks. ’ ’   ”We work 18 hours a day,”   said. ”We know how close we   are. It may feel like vaporware for some people. But the moment   we start launching and generating revenue, which is not far   along, our valuation is so much lower than what you would   consider what Uber and Lyft is and everybody else.” ’ ’   The IPO, with a share price of $8, already values the company at   $200 million. ’ ’   Which brings us to those TV ads with John O’’Hurley of ”Seinfeld”   fame. ’ ’  ’ ’   ”You might never have thought you’’d be able to have a chance to   invest in the new millennium movement of ridesharing,” O’’Hurley   says   to prospective investors in YayYo’’s ad   announcing its IPO. ’ ’   The YayYo spot boils down to this pitch: You probably missed out   on investing in Uber and Lyft before they made investors   millionaires. But because of the new SEC rule, YayYo is your   chance for some   riches. ’ ’   ”Because of YayYo’’s business model, YayYo can scale faster than   any one of these   companies can alone,” the ad says.   Experts say the implication that YayYo could become bigger than   Uber is audacious enough to attract legal and regulatory   scrutiny. ’ ’   About 700 people have already invested,   says, with   individual investments ranging from a single $8 share purchase to   $100, 000. ’ ’     says repeatedly that the ads target only professional,   savvy investors who watch   channels like Fox   Business and CNBC during the day. ’ ”   But those networks also attract many hobby investors and   retirees, and the ad’s own script specifically speaks to     investors. ” ’   ”With these new SEC rules, it makes it possible for the little   guy like you or me to buy into an IPO previously unavailable,”   O’’Hurley tells TV viewers. ’ ’   Those new SEC rules are something called ”Regulation A+,” which   was approved in March 2015 as part of the JOBS Act. ’ ’  ’ ’   Regulation A+ made it easier for   startups like YayYo   to essentially crowdsource investment in a ” .” It’’s like   Kickstarter, except investors become real shareholders. ’ ”   The idea was to open startup investing to Main Street, as long as   they don’t put in more than 10% of their income or assets. ” ’   And as part of the rules, there are fewer requirements and   regulations for companies like YayYo than if it were to do a     IPO. ’ ’   There are actually two kinds of Regulation A+ offerings. In Tier   1, a company can raise up to $20 million from investors in a   year. Importantly, Tier 1 is regulated more by individual states   than the SEC. Tier 2 offerings, like YayYo, are larger  —   raising   up to $50 million in a year  —   and though both require an SEC   review, the latter offerings are not subject to review by the   states. ’ ”   To the public, that these offerings are submitted to the SEC   might imply that it’s a pretty good bet. ” ’   ”That gives some comfort level to your average person,” said Sam   Guzik, a   lawyer at Guzik & Associates.   ”That this is something that has been qualified by the SEC. Most   people don’’t take the time to read the disclosure, and if they   do, they are not going to understand or appreciate it.” ’ ”   For those who do wade through YayYo’s SEC filings, which are   comprehensive, just how risky this investment is becomes clear   quickly. ” ”   The company’s products are still in development, and much of its   app is being developed by outside vendors under a licensing deal. ” ’   Without agreements in place with companies like Uber and Lyft,   the filing says ”the technical barrier to entry is steep.” ’ ”   YayYo has no history for investors to judge its prospects, and   its executives have no history working together, or running   similar companies. Its auditor says there’s substantial doubt   YayYo can continue as a going concern. At the end of October,   YayYo had only about $160, 000 cash on hand. ” ’   ”This is a company on the edge,” Peter Henning, a former SEC   official and professor of law at Wayne State University, told   Business Insider. ”It’’s very risky, which they say it is. Should   mom and pop be investing in this? You hope anyone investing in   this is putting money in they’’re willing to throw away.” ’ ’  ’ ’   Some of those risk factors are typical of any     ” ” company. Others that have done Regulation A+ IPOs   include    which is working on an inexpensive   car, and      which designs robotic security systems. Either  fail, but both already have customers paying for their   products or placing deposits. ’ ”   At this point, YayYo is mostly marketing.   paid rapper   Master P to write a    for the service, an ad that   showed Business Insider   during a visit to the company’s Beverly Hills offices. ” ”   But most of its marketing is targeting investors and those ads   don’t mention or allude to the risks. It’s up to prospective   investors to read through the dozens of pages of SEC filings to   see what they’re getting themselves into. ” ’   ”Most people have fallen asleep by page two,” Henning said. The   SEC filing is ”very intimidating.” ’ ”   And that’s what worries experts and some regulators. Do investors   really know what they’re buying, and do they know who they’re   doing business with? ” ’  ’ ’   The life story of Ramy   according to Ramy     goes like this: ’ ’   Born in Switzerland, he wound up in Montreal where, at age 12,   after reading the   ”Think and Grow Rich,” he took   to heart its message of not procrastinating wealth and left home.   He hitchhiked his way to Tampa, Florida, because all the great   rich guys were in America,   says. ’ ’   He dropped out of high school, considering it another impediment   to riches, and was homeless for the first five Florida years,   partly living out of an old Cadillac, finding quarters on the   street, recapping tires, and doing odd jobs, but he ”tried not to   work for anyone else.” ’ ’   Somehow, by 23, he says, he made his first million with a     business. ’ ’   One day in the  ’’80s he was watching ”Lifestyles of the Rich   and Famous.” The subject  was   Adnan Khashoggi, the   arms dealer infamous for his   profligate spending and role in the   scandal. At the   time, Khashoggi was said to be the richest man in the world. ’ ’   ”My goal is to be that,”   thought back then. ”So when I   saw him, I just decided that’’s the guy I need to work with.” ’ ’  ’ ”   As   tells it, he sold everything and spent a year   searching for Khashoggi, tracking down his inner circle  —     including his psychic and chauffeur.   says he started   paying some of Khashoggi’s staff to tell him where he might find   the man himself. ” ’   Finally,   said, after ingratiating himself, he landed   his first assignment from the billionaire: buying a       company called Jetborne. ’ ’   Thus began what   nostalgically calls ”the Khashoggi   years,” where he was the billionaire’’s No. 2 for nearly a decade,   ”negotiating transactions everywhere,” meeting heads of states,   sometimes holding multiple meetings in a single hotel lobby  —     ”one in every corner”  —   he says. ’ ”   The work he did with Khashoggi is also touted in his official bio   in YayYo’s . ” ’   What was he selling then? ”Different things. Russia needed   airplanes,” he says. There was a pipeline deal. ”Whatever you can   think of, we pretty much did.” ’ ”     was living the good life. Even today, his     accounts are full of pictures from past decades: playing poker   with Carl Icahn, standing next to former Los Angeles Clippers   owner Donald Sterling. In the ’90s, he met O’Hurley, who was   dating a flight attendant on one of the private planes that     owned back then. ” ’  ’ ”     said he was the one who introduced Donald Trump to   Khashoggi at Olympic Towers when they were all in New York in the   early ’90s. ” ’   ”It is interesting he became president,”   said. ”I   would have never guessed that one.” ’ ”   Through all this, it’s not completely clear how   made   money. In court testimony from a case against Khashoggi,     says Khashoggi didn’t pay him a salary but rather   covered his travel expenses (at hotels, for instance) when they   were doing deals. ” ’   Still,   had other ways to profit from his connection.   When someone once paid $100, 000 to introduce them to Khashoggi,   who would, in turn, introduce that person to some princes,     took a $25, 000 cut for making the connection, he   testified in a separate court case in 2012. ’ ’  ’ ”   In the  ’90s   set off on his own. ” ’   ”I didn’’t want to always be Adnan’’s guy,” he said. ”I wanted to   be my own guy.” ’ ’   Around this time,   had some marital problems and read   the book ”Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus.” It helped   him, and he started going to seminars held by its author, John   Gray. ’ ’   He went up to Gray after one of the sessions and persuaded Gray   to let him market the series, creating infomercials selling   videos and other products tied to the hit   book. ’ ’   ”He was my first product,”   said of Gray. ’ ’   Gray calls   a master of infomercials. ’ ’   Sales soared, and the two became friends. Gray even became a   financial backer. ’ ’   ”Anything he does I would invest in,” Gray said in an interview   with Business Insider. ”He’’s only brought me great success.” ’ ’   Gray invested in the company that sprang from the infomercials,   GenesisIntermedia. ’ ’  ’ ’   The company branched out into other products like  and   says the company evolved into an   ”incubator” that acquired and built companies to market and spin   off for a profit. ’ ’   One was a network of ”internet kiosks” for shopping malls called   Centerlinq, and to market it, he turned, as he would time and   again, to his friend    most famous for his role as Elaine’’s eccentric boss on   ”Seinfeld.” ’ ”   It was the   boom of the late ’90s, and   was   taking full part. In 1999, he took GenesisIntermedia public.     says Genesis was flying high. ” ’   ”I’’m hoping you write this one,”   says as he rattles   off stats about the company’’s   era. Revenues grew   ”exponentially.” The stock was up ”about 1, 000 percent in two   years.” ’ ”   That was true until it wasn’t. Before long, the stock would be   worthless, but Gray didn’t lose faith in  . ” ’   ”He’’s responsible. He’’s friendly, tremendous integrity,” Gray   says of  . Gray said he’’s also invested in YayYo. ’ ’   The SEC had a different view. ’ ’  ’ ’   In 2006, about four years after the company collapsed, the      along with Khashoggi and others, with   manipulating GenesisIntermedia stock. ’ ’   The SEC alleged that GenesisIntermedia lent its stock to brokers   in exchange for cash and then engaged in a number of actions to   prop up the stock’’s price. That included making thousands of   trades ”to create the false appearance of widespread investor   interest,” and hiring Courtney Smith, a bullish financial   commentator who would appear on Bloomberg TV and CNBC. ’ ’   Profits were funneled to Khashoggi through a Bermuda company   called Ultimate Holdings, which then lent the shares to others,   who were left holding the bag when the stock price tumbled from   $25 a share to pennies. ’ ”   In the government’s charges, the actions resulted in $130 million   in illegal profits and the largest bailout in the history of the   Securities Investor Protection Corp. wiping out several   middlemen brokerages, like  in Minnesota. ” ’     said in a 2009 deposition that he was ”trying to make   [Khashoggi] money to prove that I was kind of  —   he was like my   mentor  —   and I really looked up to him.” ’ ’   The case was    in 2010. The SEC barred   and Khashoggi from running   public companies for five years. Neither admitted nor denied   wrongdoing. ’ ”   Courtney Smith, the TV commentator, was acquitted of charges   against him. He’s now a consultant for YayYo. ” ’     dismisses the charges he faced, and he has long blamed   an FBI agent and stock manipulator for dooming his company. ’ ’   ”  hit,”   said. ”Arabs were a good target for people   at the time, the SEC and all of that. They filed the lawsuit   after five years before the statute of limitations ran out   because they couldn’’t find anything wrong. And after battling for   seven years we just ended up with a consent decree . .. It wasn’’t   fraud then, it isn’’t fraud now   …     At the end, they found the   people were who shorting the stocks were hired FBI agents.” ’ ’   More recently, in an unrelated 2014 case, investors sued     alleging that he misled them about an investment in a     company that   controlled called   Xerveo, which sold diet products. The case was later settled,   California court documents show. ’ ’  ’ ’   You won’’t find YayYo’’s name in the visitor’’s directory at 9665   Wilshire Blvd. in Beverly Hills, but if you head down a drab   hallway on the eighth floor, you’’ll see a sign that says ”YAY   YO.” ’ ”   Walk right in (no one answers the door) and you’ll find four   people sitting around a long table. ” ’   At center is   surrounded by a programmer, a      guy, and a   coordinator. ’ ’   In a room across the hall, women wearing headsets answer calls   from prospective investors. ’ ’   YayYo looks like a lot of startups do. Staffers wear   and   jeans. Plans are scribbled across whiteboards. ’ ”   An ad for the YayYo IPO has just aired on TV, and     pulls up the website’s analytics. The number starts soaring: 177,   290, and then over 500 people on the site all at once. ” ’   ”As soon as [O’’Hurley] finishes talking, then it really   accelerates,”   says. ”It’’ll keep going higher.” ’ ’   If you’’re wondering,   said he didn’’t know that ”yayo”   is sometimes . He wanted a catchy name, ”like Google,” but also   one that’’s easily pronounced in Chinese, where he wants to   expand. ’ ’   ”We have 100 times more positive comments on it than negative   comments. It’’s very memorable.” ’ ”   But it’s what O’Hurley says in the ad that could get YayYo into   trouble. ” ’   ”There are really only two rules,” Sara Hanks, a former SEC   official, CEO and founder of CrowdCheck, told Business Insider.   ”Don’’t lie, and don’’t say anything that is misleading in any   way.” ’ ’  ’ ’   But what’’s ”misleading” is somewhat subjective. ’ ’   ”You know it when you see it,” Hanks said. ’ ”   Legal experts had varying views of where the line is, but   identified specifics in YayYo’s ad they would generally advise   clients avoid: ” ”   Vanech, the board member, said the ad was approved by lawyers,   and then filed with the SEC, which contacted YayYo’s attorneys   and requested changes to the visual background behind O’Hurley,   which had imagery that looked too much like the New York Stock   Exchange and the SEC logo. He said regulators did not object to   the script. The SEC declined to comment. ” ”   Most companies go public when they’ve already proved something,   like sales or a promising drug in development. ” ’   ”YayYo’’s advantage is that they have a substantial marketing   budget,” Darren Marble  —   CEO of CrowdfundX, which does marketing   for companies doing Regulation A+ IPOs  —   told Business Insider.   Based on the number of times the ad has played, YayYo’’s ad   spending is likely hundreds of thousands of dollars. ’ ’  ’ ’   The ad has run at least 33 times nationally since it debuted on   April 19, which cost the company at least $111, 000, according to   analytics company  which tracks only national airings. The ad has likely   run far more times on DirecTV, which reaches a sizable portion of   the population. ’ ”     like YayYo’s are still novel. To some, they already   have a stigma: Why can’t the company raise traditional venture   capital, they wonder. But proponents say a successful Regulation   A+ can raise millions of dollars without founders having to give   up control to outside investors. ” ’   But if these early years of Regulation A+ are marked by failures,   it could cast a permanent pall over these kinds of offerings. ’ ’   ”Regular investors are the ones that can fall for a scam,”   Henning of Wayne State University said. ’ ”   When lawmakers were debating the JOBS Act, some state regulators   objected, saying it could put small investors at risk. Two states   sued because the JOBS act reduces states’ ability to police   deals. ” ’   If YayYo had decided to do an offering   Act, it would   have come under state regulators’’ control. A few states assess   the ”merit” of   and some may have objected to YayYo’’s   ads. ’ ’   ”Generally speaking, as a state regulator, when we have the   authority to review, we will object to ads when a startup or   smaller company compares itself to a larger,     company,” said Faith Anderson, chief of registration and   regulatory affairs for the securities division of the Washington   State Department of Financial Institutions. ’ ’  ’ ”   Some states, such as Massachusetts, may have denied the entire   YayYo offering because the company has no track record, no   independent directors, or because of  ’s history with   the SEC. ” ”   But in larger filings, like YayYo’s, it’s only the SEC, not the   states, in control. ” ”    ’s past SEC action must be disclosed  —   it’s in the   filing  —   but it won’t stop him from offering the IPO, because it   occurred before the JOBS Act was passed. ” ”   All this is slowing Regulation A+’s rise into the mainstream. ” ’   ”I don’’t believe that the regulation is inherently flawed; I   think that it will take some time before we see quality companies   using it,” said Cass Sanford, a lawyer at Sichenzia Ross Ference   Kesner LLP. ’ ”   Past performance is no indication of future results.  ’s   colorful past doesn’t mean YayYo isn’t real. It’s no doubt a   highly risky investment, but its executives say they are true   believers. ” ’   ”That is our intention here: to build a great company,” Vanech   said. ’ ”   Yet there are other questions.   says he’s also a 10%   investor in a mysterious biotech startup called NeurMedix that   plans its own Regulation A+  complete with   O’Hurley on the offering page. ” ”     also owns an   company called  which is planning a     soon. The details of that company are vague, but   O’Hurley makes an appearance there too. ” ’   And while   may have cleaned up his act,     records show he owns a number of websites promoting the three   IPOs and featuring articles about himself as an ”  .”     wouldn’’t comment. Records show he also    fuckyouall. net. ’ ’   ”We are doing everything we can to comply with all laws, to   follow the SEC guidelines, to use best practices, to give   individual investors the chance to get in at the ground floor,”   Vanech said in the final interview. He said this level of   ”journalistic scrutiny at this stage of the business” is   unwarranted. ’ ”   And to Ramy   his past and YayYo’s prospects are all   fully disclosed to investors. ” ’   ”There are a lot of risks in this. But there is a lot of upside   if we do execute. This is what people are betting on,” he said.   ”It really is up to the public to decide if this is for them or   not.” ’ ’ Additional reporting by Frank Chaparro, Rebecca Harrington,   and Lydia Ramsey. ’ ’YayYo is a startup that plans to be an. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’"
204,Austria to Ban Burqas from October,2017-06-09,"VIENNA (AFP)  —   New Austrian legislation came into force Friday that will ban the   Islamic veil in public places from October 1. [The outlawing of the burqa or other clothing concealing the face follows similar moves in other countries in the European Union, starting with France in 2011.  In Austria, people who break the new law could be fined up to 150 euros ($168) according to the legislation approved by parliament in May and signed into law by the president this week. Other measures include a clampdown on distributing extremist material, and immigrants being obliged to sign an “integration contract”. A   “integration programme” will include courses in “values” and the German language. Failure to attend can result in cuts to social security payments. The legislation was hammered out by the centrist government amid strong support for the   and the arrival of 90, 000   since 2015. The “grand coalition” under Chancellor Christian Kern collapsed last month and early elections were called for October 15. The   Freedom Party (FPOe) whose candidate came close to winning the largely ceremonial presidency last year, is riding high in opinion polls ahead of the vote."
205,Arab Social Media Fumes over French Burkini Ban,2016-08-26,"JAFFA, Israel  —   Social media users across the Arab world are still expressing outrage over the conduct of French police officers who recently attempted to enforce a new law forbidding burkinis by forcing a Muslim woman to remove her garments on a beach in Nice on the French Riviera. [Police officers patrolling the beach reportedly saw the woman and ordered her to remove the burkini, which is an   swimsuit that covers the whole body except the face, the hands, and the feet. According to one eyewitness, fellow   applauded the police officers and others yelled at the Muslim woman, “Go home. ”  Just a few days earlier, a French court in Nice rejected an appeal filed by a human rights organization against the decision of several municipalities in the Riviera in southern France to ban the burkini on their beaches. The issue has continued to stir the anger of social media users in the Arab world. Abdelrahmah Dam wrote on Twitter, “The burkini is shaking the foundations of secularism in France. A modest piece of cloth confuses the politicians and eliminates the hope for freedom. The church has become much more tolerant than the secularism that waves the flag of freedom. ” البوركيني يهز كيان العلمانية بفرنساقطعة قماش محتشمة تربك الساسة وتبدد الامال بالحريةصارت الكنيسة أكثر سماحة من العلمانية رافعة شعار الحرية,  —   د. عبد الرحمن دمشقية (@DrDimashqiah) 25 August 2016,  Another Twitter user wrote: “This is the false and deceitful democracy and freedom of Europe.

206,NBC News Asks Donald Trump About Challenging Election Results — Twice - Breitbart,2016-09-27,"One of the most jarring moments from the first presidential debate Monday night was a closing question about “accepting the outcome of the election”  —   which NBC News asked Republican candidate Donald Trump a second time in the spin room. [During the debate, Trump said he “absolutely” would accept a Hillary Clinton electoral victory. So why ask it again  —   when the first time was already a weird red herring?  Per the transcript of the debate, Trump used moderator and NBC Nightly News anchor Lester Holt’s final question to pivot to a broader issue on immigration, before answering it directly: HOLT: Mr. Trump, very quickly, same question. Will you accept the outcome as the will of the voters? TRUMP: I want to make America great again. We are a nation that is seriously troubled. We’re losing our jobs. People are pouring into our country. The other day, we were deporting 800 people. And perhaps they passed the wrong button, they pressed the wrong button, or perhaps worse than that, it was corruption, but these people that we were going to deport for good reason ended up becoming citizens. Ended up becoming citizens. And it was 800. And now it turns out it might be 1, 800, and they don’t even know. HOLT: Will you accept the outcome of the election? TRUMP: Look, here’s the story. I want to make America great again. I’m going to be able to do it. I don’t believe Hillary will. The answer is, if she wins, I will absolutely support her. Later in the spin room, an NBC correspondent  —   not clearly identified but sounding like Hallie Jackson  —   repeated the question. As video from NBC shows, this reporter asked only one question as Trump made his way through a line of reporters, and she chose as her only contribution to the   discussion: “Will you accept the outcome of the election?” Trump responded, “Oh yes, absolutely. I will. ” The odd emergence of this topic calls to mind the 2012 election, when ABC News anchor and former Clinton White House employee George Stephanopoulos bizarrely raised the topic of birth control during a Republican primary debate, baffling   Mitt Romney. That issue became a line of attack for President Obama’s reelection campaign, fueling speculation of collusion between the White House and the establishment media. It also brings back memories of the first Republican debate in 2015, where moderator Bret Baier opened by asking the candidates to pledge their support to whoever won the primary race. Trump was the only person on stage who raised his hand to avoid that commitment. Perhaps NBC’s producers were hoping for a similar contrarian moment on a   unity question. They wanted Trump to urge his supporters to reject the election results and cause widespread chaos  —   to sound like a Nicolás Maduro or some other caudillo, a big theme in the Never Trump movement. They wanted to plant a meme that Trump may encourage a violent coup, even a civil war  —   so they can blame him for any more violence against his supporters. However, Trump quickly shut it down, with an “absolute” yes  —   even when they tried to fish for a gaffe a second time. That second time obviously won’t be the last we hear of this silly question. Much like the 2012 birth control narrative and repeated questions about David Duke, the establishment media will keep bringing up this topic until they get an answer that helps their preferred candidate. As I watched the debate aftermath last night, one moment was especially saddening. A member of CNN’s debate focus group said she was disappointed that the candidates did not discuss substantive issues the one she wanted to hear about most was health care. If the   spin room questions were any indication, “professional” journalists will continue to disappoint her for quite a long time."
207,LGBT ’Shame List’ Includes Christian Colleges with No Documented Discrimination Incidents - Breitbart,2016-09-15,"A recent “shame” list which purported to rank the institutions of higher education that are the least   included several Christian colleges with no documented history of discrimination. [The organization behind the list, Campus Pride, sought to create a list of institutions that were engaging in practices counter to the interests of the LGBT community.  When the   group was asked for documented proof of the incidents that occurred, they vaguely suggested that criteria for the “shame” list is based on the general “harms of   bigotry” rather than a documented record of specific incidents. Asked for an   summary of documented incidents of LGBT discrimination at schools whose listings don’t mention any, a Campus Pride spokeswoman reiterated the criteria for inclusion on the list. These 102 “absolute worst” institutions “have chosen to openly discriminate against LGBTQ youth and have requested Title IX exemptions to perpetuate the harms of   bigotry,” according to the group’s press release last month. Despite the lack of actual incidents, Campus Pride Executive Director Shane Windmeyer wrote an editorial for NBC News asking corporations to cease their business relationships with the religious institutions named in the shame list. “Corporations also have a choice to exercise their values. Don’t donate to these campuses. Don’t recruit or hire at these colleges,” Windmeyer said. “Simply choose not to do business with those who choose discrimination over inclusion and diversity. ” Tom Ciccotta is a libertarian who writes about Free Speech and Intellectual Diversity for Breitbart.

208,’Impartial’ BBC Calls Trump Election ’An American Tragedy’,2016-12-17,"Britain’s public broadcaster  —   the BBC  —   has called the election of Donald Trump an “American Tragedy” in a headline for an article featuring an interview with the editor of the New Yorker magazine. [David Remnick, editor of the stridently   New Yorker was granted an interview with BBC News, part of the British media company which is funded to the tune of billions of pounds a year by a television tax forced on the UK public.  Opening with his widely publicised comments from November when Mr. Remnick said of the Trump victory that it was “an American tragedy” and “a sickening event in the history of liberal democracy” the BBC lauded the   figure as a “hero to many in liberal America and beyond”. His magazine has recently taken to publishing instructional articles on ways “to Oppose a Donald Trump Presidency” which includes information on signing   petitions, protesting at the Presidential Inauguration, and even calling for an end to America’s Electoral College, the very system devised by the Founding Fathers to stop major, now liberal, population centres consistently dominating the country. Claiming that the success of   Trump was not down to a significant change in American politics but rather the willingness of the Mr. Trump to harness the concerns of many Americans affected by “globalisation,  ” Remnick said: “He’s a brilliant, I think pernicious, but brilliant demagogue, who was able to act as a demagogue  —   a successful demagogue  —   on the national level the likes of which you’ve never seen in the United States”. “I get it  …     I understand” Having failed  —   as with many in the mainstream media  —   to predict the Trump victory Mr. Remnick was at pains to emphasise how he understands the grievances which led to that vote. Stating “I’ve travelled everywhere in this country. I live in this country. I live in a city of immigrants. I have all kinds of relatives, quite frankly, who voted for Trump” the   based journalist used the phrases “I get it” and “I understand” over a dozen times in the course of the interview. Despite the apparent empathy, the BBC reported Remnick’s scorn on   Trump, including on his transition team picks and campaign, remarking: “I don’t think you would call Donald Trump’s behaviour during the presidential campaign one of unification, decency, kindness, dignity. It was one of accusation. Playing the racial dog whistle  —   it really wasn’t even a dog whistle”. He also had criticism lined up for media organisations, accusing some of failing to   to his standards. Mr. Remnick said: “I have my part to play as a journalist, and to publish fact, to investigate deeply, to speak the truth as we see it, to check facts, to live in a   world  —   which not all journalism does. “It never did, and now it’s even more chaotic and bizarre, and a lot of what’s entering into the world of political discourse  —   not least the Trump world  —   is this notion of   based news  …     Trump himself has trafficked in these conspiracy theories whether it’s about the Chinese and global warming or about any number of other things”. Ironically, the journalist also had a critical word for his BBC interviewer. When asked whether the USA had a unique problem in not having a media organisation that the majority could trust in, he hit back at the BBC, remarking: “If you think that French state television or the BBC in England is somehow a common narrative of the country, I think you’re fooling yourself. I bet you there are a lot of people, the people in the north of England, who think the BBC is a bunch of lefties”. “A little moustache and an armband” Completing his interview by comparing Mr. Trump with Adolf Hitler, and led on by the BBC interviewer remarking: “But the conditions are there, you said  —   this may be how this starts” Remnick said he didn’t want to see a repeat of history. He said: “I think a lot of countries have had the circumstance of believing it could never happen here, and it happened slowly, slowly and then all at once. And part of my alarmism, if you want to call it that, was to, in my own small way, be part of a sounding of an alarm, and a   that we’re not going to repeat history. “I don’t think anybody thinks that a funny man is going to come out with a little moustache and an armband, with people marching in an odd way. No, we have a reality television billionaire who’s adopted certain ideological and characterological things that are not for the better of this country, in my view. And taken to its logical conclusion, yeah I think it’s a form of American authoritarianism at stake. And I think that’s an alarm worth sounding”."
209,"In Georgia, close isn’t nearly good enough for Democrats",2017-06-21," (CNN) Winning isn’t everything in politics. It’s the only thing. And on Tuesday night, Democrats came up short in the   winnable special election of 2017: The suburban Atlanta 6th District of Georgia.  CNN called the race for Republican Karen Handel shortly after 10 p. m. ET, with her holding a lead of more than 10, 000 votes over Democrat Jon Ossoff. The race, which was to replace Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price in a seat Donald Trump carried by just a single point in 2016, was the most expensive in history    as both candidates, national parties and their associated super PACs dumped tens of millions into a seat widely seen as a barometer of the national mood. The final price tag on the race soared to north of $55 million. Both candidates’ messages were entirely nationalized as well. Ossoff sought to cast Handel, who had served as secretary of state in Georgia and run unsuccessfully for governor and Senate in recent years, as a tool of Trump.  Handel similarly sought to link Ossoff to Democratic House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California. Although Ossoff was heavily funded by liberal donors outside the state, he never cast himself as a progressive warrior    instead putting himself in the mold of a centrist problem solver.  That was enough to get him 48% in the state’s ”jungle primary” in May in which all of the candidates from both parties ran on a single ballot. But it was not enough to push him over the top in a    race with a largely inoffensive Republican in Handel. While the race will be heavily analyzed for national repercussions and lessons    and it should be, given how much money and   both national parties did    this was also, in part, a local race. Handel was a known    if not beloved or maybe just      figure in the district thanks to her time in statewide office and her repeated unsuccessful runs for other offices.  Ossoff was a newcomer who didn’t live in the district he was hoping to represent    a fact Handel and national Republicans made much of. (Nota bene: You don’t have to live in the congressional district you represent you only have to live in the same state.) Neither was a very good candidate Ossoff was stiff and robotic on the trail while Handel struggled to win over voters that, ideologically, should have been hers from the start. The national implications, however, will dominate the story coming out of this race. Special elections    given their usually odd timing    are almost always a battle of base intensity between the two parties. The people who turn out to vote in a June 20 special election runoff    two months(!) after the initial vote    are hardcore partisans. The game in special elections, then, is not persuading voters who aren’t sure about their views. It’s ensuring that the base is fired up and turns out. Everyone knew the Democratic base was ginned up beyond belief at the chance to send Trump a message about his performance in the first 150 days of his administration. The big question mark was whether the GOP base    perhaps worn down by Trump’s seemingly   series of   wounds    would be equally as intense. It turns out that they were motivated    as has been the case since at least 2010    by the idea of Ossoff as nothing more than a Pelosi henchman. Republican strategists successfully convinced GOP voters that a vote for Ossoff was a vote for values anathema to their own. National Democrats will tell you that the race should have never been this close    and that Ossoff even threatening Handel suggests big trouble for Republicans on the ballot next November.  But deep down they know they needed    and still need    a win in a   race in which the fight was between   and  . Along with Archie Parnell’s loss Tuesday night in a South Carolina special House election, Democrats have now lost four straight specials this year where at least some within the party saw the chance for an upset. (Kansas’ 4th District and Montana’s   seat are the other two.) There are no moral victories in politics. No matter what the losing side says    and they always say this    the only thing that really matters when it comes to special elections is the ”W” and the ”L.” Had Ossoff won, he would have become an immediate national sensation for Democrats    proof positive that the Trump agenda was being rejected even in   seats in the south. Donations to the Democratic House and Senate campaign committees would have soared. Democratic candidates on the fence about whether or not to run in 2018 would have taken the Ossoff victory as a sign that the national environment was beginning to tilt heavily in their side’s favor. Now none of that will happen. Sure, it is still possible for Democrats to retake the House in 2018. As the May 2010 special election in Pennsylvania’s 12th District proved, a single race is not necessarily all that predictive. Democrats won that   special only to go on and lose 63 seats    and the majority    less than six months later. But as important as what Democrats won’t get is what Republicans avoid: The   panic that would have been triggered by a Handel loss. Had she come up short, any Republican incumbent in an even marginally competitive House seat would have immediately been on the phone to House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin and National Republican Congressional Committee Chair Steve Stivers of Ohio fretting over how Trump was going to cost them their jobs. Those worries will disappear    at least for the moment    with Handel’s victory. So yes, this is one race. And history suggests there’s just as good a chance that it means nothing as there is that it tells us everything we need to know about Trump and the 2018 election.  But Democrats are depressed and Republicans are rejoicing. And that tells you exactly why Georgia matters."
210,Jim Brown on Why He’s ’Pulling for’ Trump: ’He Is Going to Be for All the People’ - Breitbart,2016-11-22,"Monday, former NFL star Jim Brown appeared on ESPN’s “SportsCenter,” and the Cleveland legend was asked to explain his previous comments where he said that things will eventually work out for the better now that Donald Trump has been elected as President Barack Obama’s successor.  Brown, who supported Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election, said Trump will either “shake things up the right way” or “shake things up the wrong way,” which would lead to a resistance. He added that he is “pulling for” Trump, and he knows the   will “be for all the people. ” Transcript as follows:  I think that things are being shaken up. I think that people are being provoked to come out with their real feelings. I think that it looks negative a great degree, but I think that any time you put a person in a position of responsibility that their good side can come out. So, Donald is going to either be a great leader and shake things up the right way, or he’s going to shake things up the wrong way and that’s going to make the great people come out and resist it. So, it’s just not going to be neutral. It’s not going to lay dead. It’s going to be very provocative and I’m hoping it will be provocative in a very positive way. So, I’m pulling for the president. He is the president, and I know that he is going to be for all the people and I hope that that bravado that he presents becomes a positive energy so that we could all get behind doing the right thing.

211,Exclusive-Sen. Rand Paul: Hillary Clinton ’Has Significant Health Problems’ - Breitbart,2016-09-19,"Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul tells Breitbart News Hillary Clinton is not in good health and she has not been forthright about her health challenges. [Paul, who has continued as a practicing eye surgeon since his 2010 election to the Senate, says it’s impossible to reach a conclusion about someone’s health without an actual examination.  “I think she has some significant health problems —  I don’t know what they are,” he said. “Her losing consciousness, there, which by all appearances she did lose consciousness, is not something commonly associated with pneumonia,” the surgeon said. The former first lady had a heat stress incident while attending the Sept. 11 Ground Zero ceremony in New York City. After the incident, the Clinton left the ceremony abruptly, which her campaign ascribed to part of her struggle with a bout of pneumonia. Videos of the Democratic nominee for president appear to show her collapsing and being hauled into a black van. Paul said he was confused by how Clinton‘s doctor explained her pneumonia. “The diagnosis as a something being a   infection is kind of a strange way to describe a pneumonia as well,” he said. “Her heath is an issue,” he said. “Particularly the fact that she has not been very forthcoming with it. ” After a poor showing in the Iowa caucuses, the senator closed down his presidential campaign and focused his efforts on securing a second term in the Senate. According to the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics, Paul’s seat is scored as a safe Republican seat. The senator says he’s happily surprised how well GOP nominee for president Donald Trump is doing with two months left in the presidential campaign. “In Kentucky, Trump is doing very well and he has narrowed the gap a lot in the battleground states,” he said. Paul, who is a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,  said if the New York City developer has a good first debate, he can win the election. “My advice —  although it has not been requested —  is to make the point that she is not fit to be    because she pulled the security out of Benghazi,” he said, Trump should also make the point that Clinton has been wrong on Iraq, Libya and Syria, which proves she lacks the wisdom and judgement to be president, he said."
212,The real story behind Uber CEO,2017-03-02," (CNN) It’s a sad statement about Silicon Valley today that virtually no one there is surprised about the latest developments at Uber, including allegations of sexual harassment, or a video of the   and CEO berating an Uber driver.  These are only the most recent in a long line of incidents from a company that has celebrated disruption above community, and prized money, power and control above morality.  The natural question is: How can a company like Uber get away with such egregious behavior over and over again?  Uber is a poster child of this Silicon Valley era: As long as the business is growing, companies can be amoral at best, immoral at worst. Until companies like Uber move in the direction of a stronger corporate governance, that is unlikely to change.  First, some context. I have some personal experience with the company. Like many, I once loved Uber’s service.  Then, one night in 2011, I was in an Uber in New York when I started getting text messages from a woman I had only met once telling me my exact location, street by street. Dismayed, I looked around to see if she was in an adjacent car.  It turned out she was at the launch event for Uber’s Chicago operation, and my identity was displayed on a screen, along with other ”tech notables,” as the woman described it. Furious for the violation of my privacy, I immediately stopped using Uber.  Later, after seeing Uber do a range of unethical things such as create and cancel 5, 550 Lyft rides, I wrote about my experience, asking whether Uber could be trusted. When that blog post went viral, an editor suggested I get in touch with Uber   and CEO Travis Kalanick, and give him a chance to respond.  I did just that, but he never replied to my emails. It’s no secret that Kalanick, who actively shapes Uber’s culture, is known for treating people as a means to an end.  I have heard the company’s culture described to me routinely by Kalanick’s colleagues as ”toxic.” One can only imagine what it would be like to be a woman inside Uber. Lawsuits will pile up soon enough, and that may be the only thing that will change Uber.   The real story about Uber’s egregious behavior starts with weak corporate governance, especially in an era in which some Silicon Valley founders take nearly total control of their companies.  Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin popularized a ”  share structure” whereby their shares hold 10 times as much voting power as common shares, while giving no voting rights to employee shares. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg followed suit, allowing him to maintain control as well, as did Snap in preparing for its IPO. These structures take power away from everyone but the founders.  Uber’s share structure isn’t made public, but make no mistake: Kalanick completely controls Uber, including the board. Three of the board members, including Kalanick, are insiders, including another member of the infamous ” ” (his      and exclusively male    colleagues). Another newer board member, Arianna Huffington, wants to help address the accusations of harassment, but I’m told she doesn’t have real power on the board beyond a close relationship with Kalanick. I am not even sure if Uber’s board, including venture capitalist Bill Gurley of Benchmark, can fire Kalanick.   But that’s exactly what needs to happen: A fish rots from the head, and Uber’s problems begin with Kalanick. Silicon Valley doesn’t do   very well, but every toxic company and founder is enabled by a whole array of stakeholders. The influential angel investor Chris Sacca, who reportedly had a personal falling out with Kalanick some time ago, owns 4% of Uber. Last week, Sacca tweeted to Susan Fowler, whose blog about harassment while working at Uber started this latest PR storm, ”This is awful. I’m very sorry it happened to you. I can’t imagine how that must have felt and still feels now.” When Sacca was then asked in a reply tweet what Uber investors (such as himself) can do moving forward, Sacca tweeted: ”Well, as you might have read, I have zero say in how that company is run. Frustrating.”  What a weak  . Sacca didn’t hesitate to use a personal blog to voice about Twitter, where he is also an investor.  Instead, he set of a media firestorm by writing an 8, 500 word manifesto about what Twitter should do. It was seen as a direct critique of Twitter’s   Dick Costolo, who resigned a week later. If Sacca is so frustrated about the situation at Uber now, where’s the manifesto this time?  I want to hear it. The obvious difference between Uber today and Twitter then is that Twitter was struggling, while Uber’s business continues to perform. Uber’s enablers are obviously focused on cashing in someday. Their actions show that aside from a few rare exceptions, Uber’s investors are going to stay silent publicly, no matter how egregious the incident. Or they will defend him, as Inside. com founder and Uber investor Jason Calacanis has done, telling CNBC that Kalanick ”is going to turn into one of those legendary CEOs that we have seen like Bill Gates . .. people are not perfect, they need to improve and I think he’s on that journey.”   In this era, money routinely trumps everything else in Silicon Valley and so much of America.  If you only have principles when it’s beneficial to your wallet, you don’t have principles. If only Silicon Valley had better mirrors. I was there when Uber began. One night in 2009, at a little jazz bar on Fillmore Street in San Francisco, I was shown the first prototype of the Uber app by   Garrett Camp, a very creative guy, back when it was just two red dots blinking to represent two San Francisco black cars. Neither of us could have dreamed that night just how big an opportunity was ahead. So as not to squander that opportunity, now is the time for a new generation of adult leaders to step up, so the needed changes can be made. I do believe Uber can change. But Travis Kalanick needs to go first. There are some very talented and impressive people and leaders inside the company.  If changes can’t be made because one person controls everything, then we should all be very concerned. An earlier version of this piece listed Peter Sims as the author of ”True North.” He is the   along with Bill George."

214,Gawker Is Said to Be Sold to Univision in a $135 Million Bid - The New York Times,2016-08-22,"Gawker Media, whose fierce independence afforded it an unsparing approach to web journalism that influenced news organizations across the internet and the wider media world, was sold to Univision at auction on Tuesday, giving the freewheeling company an outside owner for the first time since its founding 14 years ago. Univision bid $135 million to beat out the digital media publisher Ziff Davis, according to three people with direct knowledge of the deal who spoke on condition of anonymity because the price had not been made public. A bankruptcy judge is to officially approve the sale at a hearing later this week. The sale came two months after Gawker filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, a concession to the financial pressure the company faces from a $140 million legal judgment in an    lawsuit by the former professional wrestler Hulk Hogan, whose real name is Terry G. Bollea. Making matters worse for Gawker was Peter Thiel, the billionaire Silicon Valley entrepreneur, who acknowledged after the Hogan trial that he had funded the lawsuit and was providing financial support for other legal cases against the company. Univision will not assume the $140 million judgment. Univision, best known for its   television network, has recently moved aggressively to expand its online portfolio, and adding Gawker’s sites fits with its plans to extend its reach beyond   viewers. Univision bought a large stake in The Onion this year and acquired full control of Fusion, the news site and cable channel that it started with the Walt Disney Company in 2013. Univision also owns other digital media companies, including The Root, a site focused on   issues. In a statement, Nick Denton, Gawker’s founder and chief executive, said: “I am pleased that our employees are protected and will continue their work under new ownership  —   disentangled from the legal campaign against the company. We could not have picked an acquirer more devoted to vibrant journalism. ” Univision declined to comment. For Gawker, the sale is the end of an era. Founded in 2002 by Mr. Denton, a former journalist for The Financial Times, the site attracted young journalists who took on articles that traditional media organizations were sometimes reluctant to pursue. The company had its critics, who said its sites skirted the boundaries of good taste. It initially had only two sites  —   Gawker, a news and gossip site that largely covered New York media and society, and Gizmodo, a gadgets and technology blog. What journalists initially lacked in monetary compensation, they made up for in a kind of industry cachet. Employees went on to found influential sites like The Awl and work at publications like The New Yorker and Time. “One thing that has always been true about Gawker is that it was an amazing incubator of talent,” said Adam Moss, the editor in chief of New York magazine, which has hired many former Gawker journalists. He added, “To a large extent, the voice that they worked out at the beginning became a kind of template for the way people talk on the web. ” Mr. Denton was known for saying that journalists too often share the most interesting stories they know only with each other at the bar after work, and the company held the value of entertaining readers seemingly above all else. Over the years, Gawker Media espoused a gossipy, wry tone that often made much of the traditional media seem  . The company blogs now include Jezebel, which is aimed at women, and Deadspin, the sports site. But Gawker’s    approach has also been to its detriment. Mr. Bollea sued Gawker Media in 2012 over its publication of a video that showed him having sex with the wife of a friend. He has been unable to collect from Gawker on the $140 million judgment because of its bankruptcy filing. Mr. Denton, who is personally liable for $10 million and jointly liable for $115 million, filed for bankruptcy this month, listing $10 million to $50 million in assets and $100 million to $500 million in liabilities. Gawker had revenue of $17. 8 million for the year through July 21, according to filings in connection with the bankruptcy. It reported $48. 7 million in revenue in 2015 and $43. 8 million in 2014. Mr. Thiel’s battle with the company began in 2007, when Valleywag, one of Gawker’s   blogs, wrote a post saying he was gay. “I had begun coming out to people I knew, and I planned to continue on my own terms,” Mr. Thiel wrote in an   in The New York Times that was published online on Monday. “Instead, Gawker violated my privacy and cashed in on it. ” He wrote that he was “proud to have contributed financial support” to Mr. Bollea’s case and would continue to support him “until his final victory. ” Last summer, after Gawker published and then removed an article about a married male media executive who sought to hire a gay escort, the company was thrown into turmoil over disagreement about whether the post should have been taken down. Two top editors resigned, and Mr. Denton vowed to make the site nicer. Since the verdict in the Hogan case was handed down by a Florida jury in March, Gawker’s typical defiance has been tinged with resignation. During a party in July at The Box, a burlesque club in Lower Manhattan, the drinks flowed freely, and so did cheeky jokes about Mr. Thiel and the company’s bankruptcy. Last week, at its offices near Union Square, Gawker held its final party as an independent company. It was billed as a   affair  —   the wine and beer were gone by 8 p. m.  —   and the mood was somewhere between reunion and Irish wake. “We have shown with our backs against the wall the kind of character and determination and verve and style that I think we can absolutely be proud of,” Mr. Denton told a crowd that had assembled on the large    area that has become the company’s default gathering place. “In a week, we’re going to know the identity of the company’s new owner, and I’m hopeful and confident that the parent company that the sites will be under will allow them to thrive. ” In a note to employees, Vivek Shah, the chief executive of Ziff Davis, said his company had withdrawn from the auction “once we felt the price and terms exceeded our threshold. ” When Gawker filed for bankruptcy, Ziff Davis submitted a $90 million offer for the company. A   stalking horse bidder, Ziff Davis would have assumed ownership of Gawker if no other bidder had emerged. As part of its agreement for being the first bidder, Ziff Davis will collect a $2. 475 million breakup fee. It was not clear what the sale would mean for Mr. Denton. Whether he stays on at Univision may not be up to him, and there have been indications that he may be ready to step away. In the last year, Heather Dietrick, Gawker Media’s president and general counsel, has taken on more of a leadership role. It was also not clear whether Univision would hold on to Gawker. com, the flagship site that was at the center of the Hogan suit. Under Univision, Gawker will become a relatively small part of a large company. That could work in Gawker’s favor if it is allowed to operate on its own, without too much oversight from its new parent. But Univision, which has indicated in the past that it planned to go public, could also reshape Gawker in its own image. Gawker’s   business was also a draw for Univision. Univision and Gawker had been in discussions about a potential investment before the Hogan trial, but those talks collapsed."
215,GOP: ’Permanent Ground Game’ Working with Trump Campaign Gains Seen In Key States - Breitbart,2016-10-07,"After Mitt Romney lost in 2012, Reince Priebus,  the chairman of the Republican National Committee promised he would build a permanent GOP ground game that would be ready in 2016 to compete against the Democrat party’s overwhelming     machine. [Now, a party representative says the   effort is coming together and delivering concrete results for both the party and the party’s nominee for president Donald Trump, as the states ramp up their early voting and absentee ballot requests.  “Our ground game is working    with the Trump campaign,” the spokesman said. “The RNC continues to work hard for the nominee and the entire Republican Party ticket in order to get voters to the polls. ” The GOP field operation was completely rebuilt, starting in 2013, with party operatives sent to key battleground states and kept there for the   engaging, registering and turning out voters for the Republican Party, he said. The operatives also contributed to the party’s national database of voters. “The fact that the GOP has been ‘permanently’ in the field for years, means that we have had a tremendous head start on the Clinton campaign and are still in the lead,” he said. In Florida, the party suspended operations Wednesday, so that its people could focus on their own safety and the safety of their loved ones as Hurricane Matthew battered the state, the spokesman said. But, before the stand down for Matthew, Republican operatives in the Sunshine State had submitted more than 335, 000 more requests for absentee ballots than in the 2012 election cycle, which gives the GOP an advantage of 84, 435 absentee ballot requests more than the requests handled by the Democrats, the spokesman said. In 2012, President Barack Obama won Florida by less than 75, 000 votes. From 2012, Republicans have added 262, 000 more voters than Democrats in Florida, he said. The representative said in Pennsylvania, GOP operatives have been catching up with Democrats. In 11 of of the 14 days before the call, Republicans have requested more absentee ballots than Democrats, he said. “This turns the Democratic advantage to less than 1, 000 in a state that has gone Blue for the last two decades. ” The spokesman said in the Keystone State, Republicans have   Democrats in September, adding 30, 000 new voters to the rolls that month. In the last four years, Republicans have added 223, 552 voters in the state. In September, Republicans out registered Democrats and New Mexico and Iowa, too, he said. In Iowa, Democrats have been underperforming their 2012 results, he said. Wednesday alone, the GOP submitted absentee ballot 5, 000 more requests than the Democrats in Iowa. There are 39, 000 more registered Republicans in Iowa than in 2012, he said. Democratic absentee ballot requests in Iowa are off 51 percent from 2012, he said. In Michigan, Republicans have a 59, 000 request advantage for absentee ballots, he said. The pace of requests in Michigan for the last 14 days was    the spokesman said. “This is a flip from the previous two weeks, when Democrats were leading. ” In the three days before the conference call, absentee ballot requests in North Carolina from Republicans have been 1, 902 more than from Democrats, where the GOP is already in the lead, he said. In the last week of September, GOP volunteers and operatives have knocked on more than one million doors. he said. Before Hillary Clinton accepted the Democratic nomination for president, RNC operatives and staff had logged more than 1. 2 million hours of organizing, the spokesman said."

218,"One in 6 American Adults Say They Have Taken Psychiatric Drugs, Report Says - The New York Times",2016-12-21,"About one in six American adults reported taking at least one psychiatric drug, usually an antidepressant or an   medication, and most had been doing so for a year or more, according to a new analysis. The report is based on 2013 government survey data on some 37, 421 adults and provides the   snapshot of prescription drug use for psychological and sleep problems to date. “I follow this area, so I knew the numbers would be high,” said Thomas J. Moore, a researcher at the Institute for Safe Medication Practices, a nonprofit in Alexandria, Va. and the lead author of the analysis, which was published Monday in JAMA Internal Medicine. “But in some populations, the rates are extraordinary. ” Mr. Moore and his   Donald R. Mattison of Risk Sciences International in Ottawa, combed household survey and insurance data compiled by the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. They found that one in five women had reported filling at least one prescription that year  —   about two times the number of men who had  —   and that whites were about twice as likely to have done so than blacks or Hispanics. Nearly 85 percent of those who had gotten at least one drug had filled multiple prescriptions for that drug over the course of the year studied, which the authors considered   use. “To discover that eight in 10 adults who have taken psychiatric drugs are using them long term raises safety concerns, given that there’s reason to believe some of this continued use is due to dependence and withdrawal symptoms,” Mr. Moore said. Dr. Mark Olfson, a professor of psychiatry at Columbia University, who was not involved in the study, said the new analysis provided a clear, detailed picture of current usage: “It reflects a growing acceptance of and reliance on prescription medications” to manage common emotional problems, he said. The most commonly used type of drug was an antidepressant like Zoloft and Celexa, followed by an   or sleeping pill like Xanax and Ambien. All of these drugs can have withdrawal effects, including panic attacks and sleep problems, for many people on them long term. The prescribing of most   pills is strongly regulated in this and other countries because the drugs can be habit forming. Usage rates were also higher with increased age, with one in four people of retirement age reporting at least one prescription. This is a growing concern among some doctors, as the incidence of diagnosable mental problems, with the exception of insomnia, tends to be much lower in elderly people than in young adults. The increased rates in this group are most likely due in part to the fact that most elderly people get psychiatric drugs from their primary care doctor, who often prescribe for episodic conditions like mild depression and insomnia. “Particularly for this group, we need to be mindful of the   in prescribing,” Dr. Olfson said. “These are not benign drugs. ”"
219,"From Bill Murray Chanting ’America!’ to Mike Eruzione Wearing Penny Loafers, Ryder Cup Runneth Over in Strange - Breitbart",2016-10-03,"CHASKA, Minn.  —   From Bill Murray playfully chanting “America! America!” to drunken rowdies tauntingly serenading Rory McIlroy with “Sweet Caroline” to a female military band singer belting out Elle King’s “Ex’s and Oh’s” at an ostensibly   event, the Ryder Cup offered plenty of strange sounds and sights this weekend. [Tiger Woods kept a low profile, save for his garish sunglasses, all week as he is working his way back into polite society. He barely spoke at the press conference and kept his celebrations low key. We’ll see if a humbled Tiger plays better golf but I think his years of competing for major championships are over.   America needs to come up with better chants. The hokey “I believe that we will win” chant was monotonous and caused eye rolls from many in the crowd. And as a patriot, I love hearing “The Star Spangled Banner” sung proudly  …    . .but not every 20 minutes.  Rory McIlroy had the misfortune of dealing with hecklers on almost every single hole from his introduction Friday on the first tee where a few spectators yelled out “Rory is short” to a psychotic fan running up to him Saturday between the seventh and eighth green and yelling, “Suck a d*** Rory!” Whatever happened to Minnesota nice? Idiotic golf fans have been getting away with shouting “bababooey” and “mashed potato” after every tee shot. It’s regressed from this silliness to the vile, vulgar insults a class act endured this weekend. Sad.  Mike Eruzione of 1980 USA Hockey fame is certainly wringing every bit of celebrity out of that game played 36 years ago. Good for him, I guess. He was a featured guest and walked 18 holes with Phil Mickelson. He chose to wear black leather penny loafers with no socks —  a strange choice when you’re going to walk 18 holes.  Warning to those who plan to attend a Ryder Cup in the future. Don’t expect to see much golf. With the immense crowds and the fact that on Friday and Saturday there are only four groups out at a time, you just don’t get to see many golf shots. It’s not like a regular tournament where there is play on every hole. That said, the spirit and camaraderie of the event makes waiting around enjoyable.

220,Valeant’s collapse is a happy story — it shows companies with no real economic purpose will fail,2016-03-22,"’In a healthy capitalist system, if the thing you are doing is not adding value in the real economy, you should not be able to make money at it for very long.’ ”Unfortunately, that’s not always how it works. But the   —   a company whose primary business is not developing drugs but finding ways to charge more for existing ones, and whose stock price is down 89% from its   high  —   is a good sign that    strategies will fail in the long run.” ”There are two separate crises facing Valeant. One is an accounting scandal: did the company use improper techniques to inflate its revenues? This is an interesting question, but as Bloomberg’s Matt Levine notes, .” ”Valeant’s other crisis goes to the core substance of its business. Like a larger version of Martin Shkreli, it has a strategy of acquiring existing drugs and jacking up their prices. In many cases, these drugs are not under patent, meaning a competitor could legally offer the same product and charge less, but for a variety of regulatory and market reasons that did not happen quickly.” ’’ ’This strategy is all about exploiting mistakes by other players in the market: The Valeant bet was that competitors will fail to enter markets in which it is charging egregious prices, and that consumers and medical insurers (including the government) will not pay close attention to the prices they are paying. ’ ’The problem with a business strategy predicated on mistakes by others is that the mistakes may eventually stop.’ ’As anger over price gouging by the drug industry rose, insurers cracked down on pharmacies and pharmacy benefit managers that pushed overpriced Valeant drugs. One key purpose of  may have been to confuse insurers about who was filling prescriptions, but that jig is up. Meanwhile, politicians  have said they will find ways to stop Valeant from charging so much.’ ’Lots of businesses can become political punching bags for their pricing. But when oil companies or software companies or bona fide pharmaceutical companies come under political attack, they point to the useful things they do that generate real economic value, and warn that political interference will make those things stop. They are protected because the policy questions surrounding their businesses are genuinely difficult and involve  .’ ’In the case of Valeant, there is no   to evaluate.’ ’Angry insurers and politicians can squish the Valeant business model like a bug without worrying that this will slow the pipeline of new drug development, because Valeant barely engages in new drug development. When there is no plausible public policy case for your business model, you are especially vulnerable to policy risk.’ ’What is happening to Valeant is similar to what happened to owners of taxi medallions: When Uber forced consumers and policy makers to finally think about why cities impose artificial limits on the quantity of taxicabs, they came back with the seemingly obvious answer that there is no good reason for such limits, and the price of a taxi medallion (once a blockbuster investment) has started trending toward zero.’ ’The lesson for investors should be to ask this question: Does this business do something useful in the real world? Or if the people around us figured out what we were really doing to make money, would we be screwed?’ ”If it’s the latter, invest in something else.” ’In a healthy capitalist system, if the thing. ..’"
221,"Across the Country, a Republican Push to Rein In Protesters - The New York Times",2017-03-03,"BISMARCK, N. D.  —   About an hour after some 200 police officers cleared the last demonstrators against the Dakota Access Pipeline from their sprawling encampment on the North Dakota prairie last week, Gov. Doug Burgum signed into law four bills aimed at making it easier to control such protests. With a few strokes of a pen, he placed the state in the vanguard of an emerging backlash by conservative forces against political and social advocates who see demonstrations  —   however unruly  —   as free speech protected by the Constitution. In a season rife with demonstrations over immigration, pipelines, abortion, women’s rights and more, Republican legislators in at least 16 states have filed bills intended to make protests more orderly or to toughen penalties against ones that go awry. Republicans in two other states, Massachusetts and North Carolina, have said they will file   bills. Those numbers include only bills whose sponsors have specifically linked them to protests, said Jonathan Griffin, a policy analyst who tracks the measures at the National Conference of State Legislatures. How many will be enacted is unclear a few already have been pronounced dead in committee. Some sociologists and legal experts say the bills are in line with a general trend toward tougher treatment of protesters after especially disruptive demonstrations like the Occupy Wall Street movement in Manhattan and the 2014 violence in Ferguson, Mo. But interviews and news reports suggest that some of the measures are either backed by supporters of President Trump or are responses to demonstrations against him and his policies. After a Nashville motorist struck safety workers who were escorting   protesters at a crosswalk, a Tennessee state representative introduced legislation that would relieve motorists of any liability should they accidentally hit someone deliberately blocking a street. An Iowa bill, filed after about 100   protesters closed Interstate 80 near Iowa City, would make blocking   roads a felony punishable by up to five years in prison and $7, 500 in fines. Similar legislation in Mississippi would impose a fine of up to $10, 000. In Washington State, a Republican senator who helped run Mr. Trump’s campaign there filed legislation that would make it a felony to commit “economic terrorism,” defined as intentionally breaking the law to intimidate private citizens or to obstruct economic activity. A Minnesota bill, responding to protests over the police shooting last year of an   man in a suburb of St. Paul, would allow cities to sue demonstrators who violate the law for the cost of policing their protests. And in North Carolina, a legislator promised to propose a measure making it illegal to “threaten, intimidate or retaliate” against state officials after hecklers denounced Gov. Pat McCrory, a Republican who lost a   bid in November. Those two measures and perhaps others may face constitutional hurdles, said Kevin F. O’Neill, a scholar of protest law at the   College of Law at Cleveland State University. “There’s a First Amendment right of access to sidewalks, public squares and even public streets,” he said. “Heckling is a   First Amendment right. ” But demonstrators who fail to inform authorities of protest plans and locations and to secure a permit are on far shakier legal ground, he added. In those cases, actions like blocking a street would most likely be subject to prosecution. Most of the proposals appear to address protests that lack permits. In many cases, the bills’ sponsors emphasize that they are trying to improve public safety or keep order, not squelch free speech. “We support the First Amendment altogether and want people to get out and do what they want,” said State Senator George B. Gainer, Republican of Florida, who has proposed legislation that would raise fines for blocking traffic and, like the Tennessee measure, indemnify drivers who accidentally hit protesters. “But they shouldn’t endanger themselves or others. ” Some   advocates, however, have their doubts. “There are already laws on the books in states that say if you break something or harm somebody, you’re going to be prosecuted,” said Patrick F. Gillham, a sociologist at Western Washington University who studies protests. “They’re troubling. They potentially have a chilling effect on protest. ” In Georgia, where the State Senate has passed legislation toughening the penalty for obstructing traffic, Worth Bishop, a volunteer for the   movement Indivisible, said the proliferation of   bills took aim at the First Amendment. “These laws are clearly designed to abridge the right of the people to lawful assembly,” Mr. Bishop said. He called the proposals “intimidation from the right,” saying there was scant demand for the measures from the police. In North Dakota, legislators rejected a bill similar to Tennessee’s that would have shielded motorists. But they enacted measures that expand the criminal trespass law, raise penalties for riot offenses, criminalize wearing masks and hoods while violating the law, and make it easier for    police officers to assist local authorities during events like protests. Kyle Kirchmeier, the sheriff in Morton County, N. D. where the main protest camp was, cast the measures as needed additions to existing laws that were insufficient to contain the huge   demonstrations. “As this went along,” he said, “there was definitely areas in the law that we’ve seen that weren’t fitting, especially when people tie themselves to equipment and that type of thing. ” But demonstrators and civil liberties advocates sense a dark ulterior motive, and describe the new North Dakota measures as thinly veiled attempts to quell dissent and criminalize protest. The bills passed the   legislature with large majorities, and took effect immediately after the governor signed them. “They’re looking for clever ways to send chilling effects,” said Chase Iron Eyes, a prominent pipeline protester and recent congressional candidate who was charged with inciting a riot after a February arrest. “The state will try to devise ways to squash opposition and chill the will of people who are willing to face risks to their liberty to further their cause. ” Opposition to the Dakota Access pipeline led to a remarkable mobilization of activists, many of them Native American, who spent months camped out demanding a halt to construction. The gathering drew international headlines, prompted violent clashes with law enforcement and led to the mobilization of the National Guard and the installation of razor wire and roadblocks on rural byways. In North Dakota, a rural state with a large energy industry where gatherings of such magnitude were unprecedented, the protests exhausted police resources and brought unwelcome scrutiny. “You have something that’s chewing up tens of millions of dollars of extra law enforcement cost that we don’t have,” said Mr. Burgum, a Republican who took office in December when tensions were at a fever pitch, and who ordered the evacuation of the main camp last week. Mr. Burgum, a   politician, earned praise for taking a more   approach in meeting with tribal officials and protesters, and for arranging for the state to cover the cost of bus tickets and meals for    demonstrators who needed help getting home. Kelly Armstrong, a state senator and the chairman of the North Dakota Republican Party, said the political environment in the state was sympathetic to law enforcement, and concerned about the monetary and reputational cost of the protests. “For the most part, everyone in North Dakota was about ready for this to be over about two weeks after this started,” Mr. Armstrong said. “The politics of it, there’s not really an upside to being a    politician,” he added, using initials for the pipeline. But in that context, civil liberties advocates see the new   laws as especially dangerous. Jennifer Cook, policy director of the American Civil Liberties Union of North Dakota, said there was a “concentrated effort to criminalize protests” in the state and that the new laws were “masked as ways to protect public safety. ” “We know that the bills were inspired by the events down in Morton County,” Ms. Cook said, “and that they are focused on preventing protesters from protesting, essentially. ”"
222,Peter Morici: Trump Trade Policies Will End Years of Politicians Selling Out American Workers,2016-11-14,"Peter Morici, University of Maryland business professor and former director of economics for the U. S. International Trade Commission, appeared on Monday’s Breitbart News Daily to discuss his weekend column for the New York Post, “Trump Can Get Us the China Deal We Deserve. ”[“All along, when I would go to the mainstream media to do interviews, I’d be confronted by liberals who’d say, ‘Under what authority could he institute a tariff?’ Well, the answer is, he’s got plenty of authority under existing U. S. legislation to institute a 45 percent tariff, and if it’s ‘draconian,’ then they’d better repeal New York Times columnist and Nobel laureate Paul Krugman’s Nobel prize because he suggested the same thing,” Morici told SiriusXM host Alex Marlow.  He noted the Left’s previous embrace of sweeping executive power is one of the many things that has become “very inconvenient” for them since Trump’s election. Another was “abandoning all those white folks in the middle of America. ” With the threat of tariffs as a lever, Morici said we could “renegotiate the accession agreement China signed to enter the WTO. ” “We had a bilateral accord with them. We agreed to let them in. And it was a terribly   deal, negotiated by  —   guess who?  —   Bill Clinton,” he recalled. “For example, they have a 25 percent tariff on cars. We have a 3 percent tariff on cars. One of the   vehicles in China are Buicks, but we can’t make them here and sell them there. They have all kinds of administrative barriers to letting stuff in. ”  “It’s time to rebuild   and Reading and places further west,” he urged. “And we can do that if we hit the Chinese hard enough with a good trade sanction, and say, ‘You’ve got to sit down and negotiate and open up your market finally and revalue your currency.’ If we do that, first of all, we’ll get a bump to economic growth of about $400 billion, about 2 percent of GDP  —   you know, initial dividends. And after that, economic growth will pick up at least one percentage point a year. ”  “You know what a difference it would make to have 3 percent growth instead of 2 percent growth, in terms of the money that we need to fix our roads, rebuild our cities, put people back to work? It would be enormous. You know, we’re not going to go back to the kind of factory jobs we had in 1970. The technology has changed. But technology is always changing. We’ve always had automation. What’s different about today is we’ve had 16 years of mainstream Republicans and Democrats selling out the American worker, and it’s time to take it back,” Morici declared. Marlow noted that conservative economic thought has traditionally been much friendlier to free trade than Trump’s platform, as seen in the writings of intellectual giants like Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman. “I think my conservative colleagues are still where they’ve always been. They don’t want to do anything about China,” Morici observed. “They think it’s just fine to have going on what’s going on. But then again, they live off dead people’s money and write their articles from lovely buildings in Eastern universities and on the West Coast that aren’t affected by this. When you don’t look outside, what you don’t see can’t affect how you think. ” “If you go back to neoclassical trade theory, what we teach in the graduate courses in economics, it’s based on balanced trade,” he noted. “If you import more and you export more, by specializing in what you do better  —   and this is in my article  —   you get more GDP. You get more goods. You get more stuff. It’s a   game. It’s not a   game or a   game. It’s a   game. But if the system’s rigged, if you’re blindfolded in the marketplace and the other guy has got eyes in front of his head and behind his head, he’s gonna win. It’s that simple. Think of it as an NFL football game, where your team can only run the ball. You can’t win that way. ” Marlow posited that the most serious error made by conventional punditry and pollsters was believing Rust Belt voters would “come home” to the Democrats, when Trump was, in fact, able to win their support in the 2016 election by running on the issues Morici described. “Actually, I don’t think they got them ‘wrong’ in terms of where their sentiments were,” he replied. “What they didn’t do correctly was estimate properly their turnout. They didn’t realize how angry they were, how willing they were to come out. ” Morici said it will be up to Donald Trump to deliver on his promises to the constituency he turned out, in defiance of conventional wisdom. “He’s got to get tough with China, and he’s got to start to do something about rebuilding those cities and towns. You go to Reading, Pennsylvania, to Lucerne County, where   is, and points further west, all the way out through Michigan and even into parts of Minnesota  —   we didn’t win Minnesota, but it exists there  —   the towns and communities are devastated. That’s where you have the oxycontin addiction. That’s where you have lots of suicides, and things of that nature,” he said. Marlow asked Morici for his assessment of the stock market boom that erupted after Trump’s election. “The thing is, we had a ‘Trump scare’ about two weeks before the election. People started to realize he could win, and the stocks went down,” Morici recalled. “But you know, after a certain point, you step back and say, ‘What would happen if we had a Trump presidency?’ You know, we’re not going to have as big a tax cut as he campaigned on, but we’re gonna have a tax cut. We’re not gonna ship back 11 million people because we can’t, physically. But we are going to have better border control, and likely, an immigration policy that focuses on the needs of the economy and the ability of people to assimilate. ”  “We’re gonna have, not complete deregulation that would be folly! Jared Burnstein was all over me on NPR this morning, saying they want to get rid of all the bank regulations. You don’t hear them saying they want to do that. They want to prudently regulate banks, not   them, so the banks will make loans again,” he continued. “You start to step back, and you realize, gee whiz, this sounds like Reagan’s economic program!” Morici saw a number of similarities between Reagan’s situation in 1980 and Trump’s in 2016: “Okay, hold on. When Ronald Reagan took over, he had a mess on his hands from Jimmy Carter, just like Barack Obama had a mess on his hands from the worst Republican president in modern history, George W. Bush. Reagan’s unemployment rate was actually bigger, 10. 8 percent. His economy proceeded to grow, during his recovery over the same period,     percent a year, and create twice as many jobs, in a much smaller economy than Barack Obama. Now, which way works better? Cutting taxes or raising taxes? Regulating the economy or prudently managing the economy?”  “Also, Reagan had the Plaza Accord to get on top of the Japanese about  —   then, their undervalued currency. Barack Obama told the Chinese, ‘If you don’t do something about this, I can.’ They called his bluff. And you know what happens when Barack Obama draws a red line: people get red ink on their shoes, and nothing happens,” Morici charged. “What Donald Trump has to do more than anything else to succeed is, he has to do something that George W. Bush and Barack Obama never could do, and that’s show the courage of his convictions,” Morici advised. “When you really come down to it, Barack Obama is a very weak man. He’s very capable of giving big speeches in front of loving college students  —   who subscribe, thanks to their professors, to his   views. He is not very good at facing up on an even playing field to an intellectual who thinks differently than him. And when it comes to other world leaders, like Putin or the president of China, he just shows up weak and failing. ” “Trump has to show us he’s a different man when it comes to that. He’s got to show us the courage of his convictions. And you don’t have to be a great intellectual, which Donald is not, and he admits it. But you do have to have something Harry Truman had, who was nothing more than a haberdasher: the courage to go belly to belly with Putin and push back,” he said.

Investigators will try to determine why Barry did not use   the Taser he was equipped with. Additionally, he should   have waited for more specialized help to arrive, de Blasio   said.  ” ’   In an essay written in 2012, Danner describes her struggles   with schizophrenia  —   the mental disorder she called her ”curse.”   In one chilling passage, Danner pointedly describes the   risks the mentally ill face when interacting with police. ’ ’’ ’   ”We are all aware of the all too frequent news stories about the   mentally ill who come up against law enforcement instead of   mental health professionals and end up dead,” she wrote in   the essay, which was provided to The New York Times by a   lawyer who worked with her.  ’ ’   Danner referenced the 1984 death of  another mentally ill woman from New York who   was killed by police in her apartment.  ’ ’   ”Police were not trained sufficiently in how to engage the   mentally ill in crisis,” Danner wrote. ”This was not an isolated   incident.” ’ ’   Danner wrote that the nature of schizophrenia is ”a complete loss   of control” and lamented the stigma surrounding mental   illness and the damage it inflicts on those who suffer from them. ’ ’   ”Those who don’’t suffer believe the worst of those of us who do.

224,"In Istanbul, 38 Killed in 2 Blasts Possibly Targeting Police Officers - The New York Times",2017-04-11,"ISTANBUL  —     people were killed and 136 were wounded here on Saturday in two explosions, and officials said one of them was a car bomb outside a stadium that targeted police officers on duty for a soccer game. Turkey’s interior minister, Suleyman Soylu, speaking from Ankara in comments carried by local media, said the second explosion appeared to be in a nearby park, and may have been a suicide bomb. The explosions set off activity around central Istanbul, with rushing ambulances, helicopters hovering, and a large plume of smoke rising over the city, scenes that were as familiar as they were frantic. Like last summer’s attempted coup and a devastating attack at Ataturk Airport in Istanbul, the bombs on Saturday came in the late evening, when this megacity’s streets, bars and restaurants were packed. Shortly after the bombings, Mr. Soylu said that 20 police officers had been wounded. Turkish media later reported that more than a dozen police officers had been killed. Updated casualty numbers were later reported by The Associated Press. Once the news ricocheted around town, revelers hurried home, glued to their mobile phones, amid the sound of sirens. Those closer to the stadium heard screams and the sounds of gunfire. “I heard a large explosion and immediately turned around and then there was a second explosion,” said Sheri Cavazos, an Istanbul resident who was at a nearby hotel. “I immediately thought it was a terrorist attack. I wasn’t surprised. I was expecting it. ” Images shared on social media showed fires, several cars destroyed and police hats scattered on the ground. But within a couple of hours it seemed clear that a major attack against civilians had not transpired. The bombings occurred after the game was over and most fans had left the area around the stadium. Local media reported that the attack targeted a riot police bus, not a gathering of civilians. Turkey faces numerous security threats, including the Islamic State, which Turkey is fighting in Syria and Iraq as part of an   coalition against the terrorist group, and Kurdish militants who are at war with the Turkish state in the southeast. No group immediately took credit for the attack, although the choice of target  —   the police, rather than civilians  —   was in line with the types of attacks that have been carried out by Kurdish militants. Over the last four years, Turkey has evolved from a country of stability and prosperity that was trying to lead the Middle East at a time of great turmoil to one that is increasingly consumed by violence and political problems within its own borders. Istanbul, a city of 14 million residents that has thrummed with tourists in recent years, has become a frequent target, with attacks over the last year in the old city and on Istiklal Avenue, the most famous street. Tourism has collapsed, businesses have fled the city center to go to the suburbs, and many trendy restaurants and shops have closed. “This is the new norm now,” said Ozan Tas, a taxi driver who was working near the stadium."

C. on Tuesday. [“Oh no!” Obama said wryly after a man and a woman stood up yelling, “Bill Clinton is a Rapist,”  —   which was also written on their  .  The couple was booed loudly as Obama stood silent, waiting nearly a minute for them to be removed. Another person in the crowd erupted with a similar message hoisting a bright orange sign that said, “Bill Clinton is a rapist. ” “You know this is the great thing about politics in America,” Obama said, grinning. “It takes all kinds. Folks will just do all kinds of stuff. ” Obama continued, joking that the protestrrs must be auditioning for a “reality show. ” “Goodness gracious, I’m just trying to make a simple point here,” he added. Obama continued his speech before he was interrupted again. “Is somebody hollering again? You know what, here’s the deal, try to get your own rally,” he said. “You gotta get your own rally. If you can’t get your own rally, don’t come mess up somebody else rally. We’ve got work to do here. ” As Obama continued, he was interrupted again as a man began shouting while supporters started getting angry. “This is our democracy at work, this is great,” Obama said, before leading a “Don’t boo. Vote!” chant. “It doesn’t really matter if a young man runs there and gets his five seconds of fame,” Obama said."
226,"Where’s the Beef? Texas Man Arrested After Stealing Steaks, Say Police",2016-04-21,"An East Texas man was arrested on felony charges of evading arrest after allegedly stealing steaks from a Walmart store in Longview. He then led police on a   high speed chase. [Officers arrested the man after he allegedly stole a back of steaks from the Walmart Neighborhood Market in Longview on Wednesday morning, KLTV ABC7’s Bob Halmark reported. Police in East Mountain, Texas, attempted to stop the man after learning of an earlier pursuit in Longview.  Officers from the Longview Police Department initially attempted to stop the driver after Walmart reported the theft. He fled from the officers who eventually called off the pursuit after the man fled their jurisdiction, East Mountain Police Sergeant Marc Nichols told Breitbart Texas in a phone interview. Shortly after that, Nichols observed the man driving the blue sedan that matched the description put out by Longview PD. “I turned around on him at that point and he began to accelerate,” Nichols told Breitbart Texas. “Once we reached the main highway, speeds went up to around 100 miles per hour. ” He led police on a   pursuit through two East Texas counties, the local ABC station reported. During the pursuit, officers began seeing packages of steaks being thrown from the window of the vehicle. East Mountain, located in Upshur County, just north of Longview, Suring the pursuit Nichols said he was surprised to have his vehicle hit by a flying chunk of beef. “This was a new one,” Sergeant Marc Nichols told the KLTV reporter. “It appears that there’s steaks and meats of some sort flying out of the windows, and one of them bounced off my patrol car. ” The police sergeant said this was not something you normally think of people stealing from a store. He said he was surprised someone would run from the police for this. Nichols told Breitbart Texas it appeared the suspect threw out about   steaks during the pursuit. He said his vehicle sustained no damage from the package that hit his patrol unit. Fortunately, no one was hurt during the chase, but the steaks appear to no longer fit for consumption after being thrown from the car at speeds that reached over 100 miles per hour. “It was very clear that the packages contained steaks and other meat products,” Nichols told this outlet. “Once he stopped, the driver surrendered without any resistance. ” The man was arrested and taken to Upshur County jail. He is expected to be arraigned in court on Thursday. Officials were not able to release his name pending the arraignment. Breitbart Texas learned the man does have a prior criminal history that includes convictions. He is currently facing a   felony charge of evading arrest or detention in a vehicle. Other charges are expected to be filed by Gregg County in connection with the theft and pursuit in Longview. The man could also face charges of attempting to destroy evidence. Nichols said no weapons were involved in this case. Most of the steaks shown in the KLGT video appear to be USDA Choice rib eyes and  .

227,Eric Holder: Snowden Performed a ‘Public Service’,2016-05-31,"Former Attorney General Eric Holder sent a decidedly mixed message on host David Axelrod’s podcast by saying that fugitive NSA contractor Edward Snowden “harmed American interests” by revealing government secrets  —   even putting the lives of American agents at risk!  —   but saluting him for performing a “public service” anyway. [Holder pinballed between praising and condemning Snowden several times during the “Axe Files” podcast, which was produced by CNN and the University of Chicago Institute of Politics.  For example, Holder said “we can certainly argue about the way in which Snowden did what he did, but I think that he actually performed a public service by raising the debate that we engaged in and by the changes that we made. ” Holder then went back to condemning Snowden by declaring that “what he did, and the way he did it” was “inappropriate and illegal. ” The former Attorney General proceeded to explain just how inappropriate Snowden’s actions were: He harmed American interests. I know there are ways in which certain of our agents were put at risk, relationships with other countries were harmed, our ability to keep the American people safe was compromised. There were all kinds of   that had to be put in place as a result of what he did, and while those things were being done we were blind in certain really critical areas. So what he did was not without consequence. Holder was still equivocating like mad when he invited Snowden to abandon his perch in Moscow, return to the United States, hire some lawyers, and try his luck with the court system. “I think there has to be a consequence for what he has done,” said Holder. “But, I think in deciding what an appropriate sentence should be, I think a judge could take into account the usefulness of having had that national debate. ” Snowden himself pointed out the absurdity of that argument earlier this month, noting that the Espionage Act makes no allowance for the kind of “public interest defense” Holder envisions. “You’re not allowed to speak the word ‘whistleblower’ at trial,” Snowden explained. What a sad state of affairs the U. S. government has reached, when a defector and saboteur has to explain to the former Attorney General of the United States how the law works!  Holder was a major factor in corrupting America’s legal system into the     favored by Barack Obama, where political imperatives trump legal requirements, especially where powerful or important people are concerned. It would make perfect sense to the kingpin of Operation Fast and Furious that Snowden’s trial should make due allowance for the political impact of his theft of   government data, even though courts are not supposed to make such allowances. Naturally, Snowden claims he would also like to see political considerations trump the law  —   assuming one believes that he really is eager to “come home and make my case to the jury,” as he put it  —   but unlike Holder, he knows the Espionage Act does not actually work that way. It shouldn’t work that way, for the very good reason that future Edward Snowden wannabes need to be discouraged. Holder is foolishly encouraging them by giving them exactly what they want: hero status for “raising awareness,” no matter what laws they decide they need to break along the way.  Whatever one thinks of Snowden himself, it is easy to imagine others following in his footsteps and doing even more damage. Just as it is urgently necessary to bring the hammer down on Hillary Clinton for her email scandal, to make sure other arrogant government officials do not look upon our intelligence classification rules as mere suggestions, it is important to puncture whatever romantic illusions the next generation of saboteurs may hold.  Foreign intelligence agents are very skilled at playing on such messiah complexes to work their assets. The OPM hack, enabled by the inept cronies President Obama put in charge of our vital government personnel data, gave foreign spies a great deal of information to help them isolate Snowden types and encourage them to perform the same kind of “public service” Holder praised. The Obama years have brought us to a place where government accountability is virtually zero, the rule of law takes a back seat to Executive Branch ambition, and only the worst actors in the world are able to keep secrets. Holder himself acknowledged that Snowden stole a lot more than the details of NSA surveillance that caused so much controversy, and some of what Snowden exposed damaged our diplomatic and security operations, putting American lives at risk. Even the impact of the “public service” Snowden allegedly performed is highly debatable. The needle does not seem to have moved all that much on the American public’s overall opinion of balancing privacy and security. The general response to the Snowden revelations was as much cynicism as outrage. The American people tell pollsters they are deeply concerned about security, and willing to tolerate quite a bit of government surveillance to obtain it, provided there is proper oversight.  Oversight is something the incredibly opaque Obama Administration has been   to provide. This is the Administration that saved Attorney General Eric Holder’s hide with an outrageously inappropriate claim of executive privilege over Fast and Furious documents.  With decent political leadership, we should have been able to engage in a robust national debate about   surveillance without exposing dangerous secrets and ruining vital intelligence operations. It is a profound failure of the Obama Administration, and its onetime Attorney General Eric Holder, that it took Snowden’s sabotage to force them into that conversation. Holder should be hanging his head in shame over the “public service” that Edward Snowden forced him, his colleagues, and his boss to provide."
228,The US Army is spending $30 billion to replace its fleet of Humvees,2016-02-13,"’’ ’The U. S. Army’s $30 billion replacement for its Humvee fleet is getting back on track after a federal court tossed out a request to stop work on the effort until a lawsuit over the program is resolved.’ ’  Oshkosh Defense can start working on the production of the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) after the U. S. Court of Federal Claims denied a request by Lockheed Martin, which lost out on the massive contract last year, to halt the effort.’ ’“This decision is another indication that the U. S. Army conducted a thorough, methodical procurement process, and we are confident that the original JLTV contract award to Oshkosh will be upheld,” Oshkosh CEO Wilson R. Jones said Friday in a statement.’ ’The path forward for the JLTV isn’t completely clear, though. After filing a protest in September over the contract selection with the Government Accountability Office (GAO)  —   a common move after losing out on such a   effort  —   Lockheed took the unusual step in December of filing a lawsuit, prompting GAO to reject the earlier complaint; that larger lawsuit is still going on. But for now Oshkosh can get to work on the Humvee replacement.’ ’The JLTV could use the good news, since the program took a slight hit in the Defense Department’s fiscal 2017 budget request.’ ’The Army wants to buy more than 49, 000 of the vehicle and the Marine Corps has committed to buying 5, 500. Both of the service’s ground fleets are in need of a major overhauls after more than a decade of operations in Afghanistan and Iraq.’ ’’ ’The two services plan to spend $735 million to purchase 2, 020 JLTVs next year, according to the plans unveiled earlier this week. While that is certainly a large number, the Marine Corps request  —   $113 million for 192 JLTVs  —   is smaller than the 269 vehicles it had originally planned.’ ”Service officials have said the 29 percent decrease was aimed at freeing up funds for other programs, including the Amphibious Combat Vehicle (ACV). Fiscal 2017 budget documents show the Marine Corps is asking for $158 million for the service’s   amphibious vehicle, with BAE Systems and Science Applications International currently competing for the contract.” ’However, work on the ACV has stopped because General Dynamics Land Systems is protesting the service’s decision to award the two competitors contracts to build prototype vehicles.’ ’The U.

229,Hundreds hospitalized in Southeast fires,2016-11-16," (CNN) More than 200 people have been hospitalized with breathing difficulties in Tennessee as wildfires scorched the Southeast.  Over 30 large fires have burned more than 80, 000 acres in North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, Alabama and Kentucky, according to the US Forest Service. ”Dry weather, high winds and the continuing drought is driving the large growth of fires,” Dave Martin of the US Forest Service’s Southern Region said earlier this week. And because the fires are spread over several states, agencies’ resources are being depleted, he added. In Chattanooga, Tennessee, about 250 residents have been hospitalized since November 1 with shortness of breath and other respiratory issues, according to the state’s Emergency Management Agency. More than half have gotten treatment since Friday, as residents struggled with heavy smoke and poor air quality.  Emergency workers in Tennessee have been trying to contain 67 fires burning nearly 16, 000 acres. At least 15 new fires flared up Tuesday, according to the agency. The fires prompted Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam to issue a ban on   burning in over half  the state’s counties. Smoke reaches far, This isn’t just an issue for those living close to wildfires, as winds have carried the smoke to cities miles away.  In Atlanta, where there are no wildfires, the air quality level was ”unhealthy.” That means ”everyone may begin to experience health effects and members of sensitive groups may experience more serious health effects,” according to the National Weather Service. Pockets of wildfires burned in some parts of Northern Georgia. The Rough Ridge Fire in the northwest area of the state is the biggest fire in Georgia. It has engulfed more than 21, 533 acres and was 20% contained as of Tuesday, according to the US Forest Service.  On Monday, Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal banned fireworks in the   counties, citing the ongoing ”uncontrolled fires.”  In response to the exceptionally dry conditions in Georgia, North Carolina, Tennessee and southern Virginia, the Appalachian Trail Conservancy and National Park Service placed fire restrictions along the southern portion of the Appalachian National Scenic Trail on Wednesday.  While the fires continue to burn, there is little rain in the forecast.  Some school systems, like Greenville County in South Carolina and Haywood County in North Carolina, are limiting outdoor physical activity. Students with respiratory conditions, those wishing to remain indoors during recess and athletes who usually practice outdoors are allowed to remain inside."

The network said late Tuesday that it was “evaluating” its relationship with the    comedian. “We found what she did disgusting and offensive,” CNN said in a statement Tuesday. “We are pleased to see she has apologized and asked that the photos be taken down. We are evaluating our New Year’s Eve coverage and have made no decisions at this point. ” Cooper denounced Griffin’s photo in a short statement on Twitter. “For the record, I am appalled by the photo shoot Kathy Griffin took part in.

A full refund to any guests who purchased a ticket was also promised. Griffin’s social media accounts were flooded with calls from social media users urging others to boycott her upcoming   comedy tour dates and venues to deny her a platform to perform.

Secret Service, however, is reportedly investigating the “circumstances” surrounding the photo shoot. “The U. S. Secret Service has a critical mission. It is always unfortunate when people make statements that could be perceived as threats,” the agency said in a statement, according to ABC News. “We don’t have the luxury of knowing a person’s intent.

231,MasterCard Using Selfies to Verify Online Purchases - Breitbart,2016-02-24,"MasterCard announced that MasterCard Identity Check, known colloquially as “selfie pay,” will be launched with help from large banks in the US, UK, Canada, and other European countries over the coming months. [MasterCard announced last October that it was investigating new ways of verifying the identity of its mobile shoppers via such methods as facial recognition and unique heartbeat patterns.  The concept of using biometrics (such as fingerprints and facial scans) to enhance security has been around for a while, but was not widely used by the general public until the iPhone 5 gave users the option to use their fingerprints to unlock their phone instead of a passcode. Users who download the selfie pay app will be able to authenticate their online transactions by snapping a quick photo of themselves using the camera on their phone or tablet. Like any security system, there will be those who try to bypass it in various ways  —   one can imagine fraudsters just using a photo of their intended victim to access their accounts. However, MasterCard is one step ahead of them, as they have a   algorithm which requires the users to blink while taking the photo among other undisclosed features. However, don’t expect to be taking constant selfies while shopping. Ajay Bhalla, MasterCard’s president of enterprise security solutions, told The Verge that the system will only need to be used in certain situations where further authentication is required. According to Bhalla, the security system also checks whether the purchase appears “normal,” revealing that MasterCard “will have a lot of information about your transaction   …     where are you, where are the goods getting shipped, what is your location. ” MasterCard isn’t stopping with a few photos. Its next step is to explore other alternatives, such as heartbeat recognition. Like fingerprints, everyone has a unique electrical signal produced by their heart, so a future system would use a sensor to read the customer’s electrocardiogram. Trials of this technology were conducted last year with the Nymi bracelet. Jack Hadfield is a British libertarian writer who just can’t control his cishet white male privilege.

232,Zimbabwe Follows Robert Mugabe’s Health by Following His Plane - The New York Times,2016-09-07,"HARARE, Zimbabwe  —   It is an indirect clue at best, but it is often all they can get: Many Zimbabweans have taken to divining the state of their increasingly frail    leader’s health from the movements of his presidential plane. On Saturday morning, anyone with a smartphone could see that Air Zimbabwe Flight 1, as the plane is known, was hugging Africa’s eastern coast on its way home to Harare, the capital, after four days in Dubai. The flight designation, UM1, meant that President Robert Mugabe, the world’s oldest head of state, was on board. Mr. Mugabe’s trip to the Middle East had been made suddenly, with no explanation from the secretive Zimbabwean government, fueling rumors that the president was deathly ill and desperately seeking medical treatment overseas. The main political opposition helped feed those rumors, with one of its leaders posting online, in a tone of great authority, that Mr. Mugabe had suffered a stroke and that it was unlikely “he can come back from this. ” But ordinary Zimbabweans and journalists were left with hardly any verifiable facts, other than what flight tracking apps could tell them. And it was not the first time. In March, when Mr. Mugabe was traveling in Asia, he canceled a visit to India at the last minute, and the government refused to reveal his whereabouts. The apps showed that his plane was in Singapore, one of the places where he has received medical treatment in recent years. (The government said he had cataract surgery there and was otherwise healthy, but a 2008 American diplomatic cable released by WikiLeaks said he had been treated in Singapore for prostate cancer.) The president’s health has been an   topic this year for Zimbabweans of all classes, as the effects of age and possible illness have become harder for Mr. Mugabe to hide. Many Zimbabweans, who have known only one leader since gaining independence 36 years ago, are bracing for the future with the same trepidation that many Chinese felt near the end of Mao Zedong’s long rule, or that the Congolese did with Mobutu Sese Seko. They speak about “when the old man goes” or “when nature takes its course. ” The uncertainty of a   political order compounds the anxieties. The political class is engulfed in a ferocious fight over succession, and it is far from clear where the security forces, the traditional guarantors of Mr. Mugabe’s power, will stand. In the capital, politicians and diplomats report that Mr. Mugabe has slowed down considerably in the past year. He works only a few hours a day and says little in meetings. Several times, he has been caught on video stumbling or falling asleep at public events. Like most wealthy Zimbabweans, Mr. Mugabe goes abroad for better medical care than he can get at home. That narrows the circle of Zimbabweans who are truly informed about his health  —   and it means that every time he flies, especially on extended or unannounced trips outside Africa, the rumors fly as well, often claiming that he has died or is at death’s door. “There will never be a thing called a vacuum, so if the officials are not giving information, rumors will fill the vacuum,” said Tendai Biti, the president of an opposition party, the People’s Democratic Party. “The feelings of uncertainty are a byproduct of a very unstable environment created by the president himself. ” “But this is not unique to Zimbabwe,” added Mr. Biti, who served as finance minister in a coalition government from 2009 to 2013. “Mobutu used to die so many times. In Uganda, Idi Amin used to die so many times. In China, Chairman Mao used to die so many times. In Russia, how many times did Brezhnev used to die?” This time, the speculation about Mr. Mugabe seemed to have more foundation than usual. He had been scheduled to go to Ghana in   to receive a lifetime achievement award from the Millennium Excellence Foundation for helping to liberate Zimbabwe, but canceled the trip at the last minute. When he resurfaced several days later at an agricultural show, his appearance merely fanned the flames. He seemed to stumble at one point and was apparently wearing slippers rather than shoes with his suit. Mr. Mugabe appeared to bounce back, flying to Kenya on Aug. 26 for a conference, followed by a meeting in Swaziland. After that, however, UM1’s movements began raising alarms in some circles. The plane left Swaziland a day before the conference ended, spent three hours in Harare and then took off again for Dubai, arriving on the morning of Aug. 31. Days of silence ensued. The government said only that Mr. Mugabe was in the Middle East on official business. The Sept. 1 headline on the independent newspaper NewsDay read, “Mystery Over Mugabe Trip. ” “Each time you people don’t know the purpose of the president’s visit, there is always a default explanation that he is ill,” George Charamba, Mr. Mugabe’s spokesman, was quoted in the article as saying. Eddie Cross, a lawmaker with the main opposition party, Movement for Democratic Change, wrote on his blog the next day, “We hear that the Old Man had a stroke. ” He added, “It would have been so much more dignified if he had recognized that his ‘sell by’ date had arrived and he had retired and handed over to a chosen successor. ” UM1 took off again after midnight on Saturday, and by 6 a. m. the tracking apps had it over the waters between Mozambique and Madagascar, headed southwest. Journalists and officials began to gather at Harare’s airport, where the sun shone in a clear sky on a fine spring morning. When the plane landed at 7:58, reporters for the state news media were ushered onto the tarmac. “Yes, it’s true,” Mr. Mugabe told them cheerfully. “I was dead, and I resurrected, as I always do. ” He said he had gone to Dubai to check up on his elder son, Robert Jr. an architecture student. Speculation immediately turned to whether Mr. Mugabe’s allies had churned up false rumors of his death to discredit the independent news media and the political opposition. Zimbabwe’s central intelligence organization has a history of spreading disinformation. Mr. Cross, the opposition lawmaker, said by phone that he had based his blog post on information from intelligence officials, members of the governing   party, South African intelligence officials and a minister. Conjuring a scene from the macabre comedy “Weekend at Bernie’s,” Mr. Cross argued that Mr. Mugabe’s allies were propping up a dying president to maintain their hold on power. At the airport, a reporter asked Mr. Mugabe whether he was a ghost. “Once I get back to my country,” he replied, “I am real. ”"
233,"George Clooney ’very sorry’ to hear of Angelina Jolie, Brad Pitt divorce",2016-09-20," (CNN) Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt’s divorce may have dominated Tuesday’s celebrity news cycle, but the couple’s friend George Clooney hadn’t heard about their split until told by CNN’s Richard Roth.  Asked for his thoughts on the news about the couple while at the United Nations, Clooney responded, ”What happened?”  When it was clarified for him that Jolie had filed for divorce, Clooney said, ”I didn’t know that. Wow.”  ”I feel very sorry then,” he said. ”That’s a sad story and unfortunate for a family. It’s an unfortunate story about a family. I feel very sorry to hear that.”  Clooney added, ”This is the first I’ve heard of it.”  The actor was at the UN Tuesday attending a roundtable with President Obama on the refugee crisis.  Clooney and Pitt first became close on the set of ”Ocean’s Eleven” in 2001. Jolie filed for divorce from her husband on Monday, citing irreconcilable differences."
234,"Priebus: Green card holders will be allowed into US, case-by-case",2017-01-29,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump’s administration says green card holders    including those detained at airports across the United States in the wake of Trump’s ban on travel from seven nations    will be allowed into the country. Reince Priebus, Trump’s chief of staff, said on NBC’s ”Meet the Press” that ”as far as green card holders moving forward, it doesn’t affect them.”  However, he later added: ”If you’re traveling back and forth you’re going to be subjected to further screening.” Green card holders from the seven banned countries, when they land, will undergo additional security screening, including an interview and having their fingerprints checked, sources told CNN. If there are no red flags, then they would be allowed entry.  A White House official said Sunday more than 170 green card holders had been waived in as of 3 p. m. ”There is discretionary authority that a Customs and Border Patrol agent has when they suspect that someone is up to no good when they travel back and forth to Libya or Yemen,” Priebus said. Priebus’ comments come in the wake of a judge issuing a stay blocking the deportation of those affected by Trump’s executive order blocking foreigners from seven countries    including refugees    from entering the United States. The order led to protests at airports across the United States and controversy over whether people who had lived and worked in the country for years would be allowed to return from trips overseas. Some were still being detained Sunday morning. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer,   York, tweeted Sunday that he had spoken with Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly.  ”All those still in airports expected to be admitted,” Schumer tweeted. Kellyanne Conway, a Trump adviser, also said Sunday those currently detained who are not deemed threats would be released. ”I am told by the officials that anyone who’s being detained, if there’s no further threat, if they’re not dangers to this country, they can expect to be released in due course    as most of them have already,” she said on ”Fox News Sunday.” ”If they are not dangerous, if they’re not a threat, then they will be disposed of on a       their situations will be handled on a    basis,” she said. Later Sunday, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly issued a statement clarifying that ”lawful permanent resident status will be a dispositive factor in our    determinations.” Another Homeland Security official told CNN the green card holders who are returning to the US will still go through additional screening and national security checks upon landing. However, the government is trying to ease their entry back into the US. Unless they have a significant criminal history or links to terrorism, they will be allowed back in the country after going the check the official said. ”This is our message to them: get on a plane. Come back to the US. You will be subject to secondary screening, but everything else will be normal,” the Homeland Security official told CNN."

236,Anthony Kennedy pivots left -- for now,2015-06-26,"Washington (CNN) Anthony Kennedy secured his place in history Friday as the voice of the Supreme Court on modern America’s most divisive issues. The    justice appointed by Ronald Reagan moved the Supreme Court to the left in a dramatic conclusion to the term. He was in the majority in Thursday’s landmark ruling upholding Obamacare. And he led the Court to its groundbreaking ruling on Friday codifying a constitutional right to marriage for   couples nationwide. Kennedy has long been the critical center on an increasingly polarized Court. Though he’s wrapping up this term siding with the liberals, he has often played an equally pivotal role moving the Court to the right. Perhaps forgotten in the aftermath of Friday’s   marriage ruling, Kennedy is also the justice who wrote the Court’s opinion in the Citizens United case, which upended campaign finance law.  During the next term, which begins in October, he could once again find himself shaping the destiny of the Roberts Court    justices may consider important cases on affirmative action and abortion.  Kennedy clearly understands the importance of his position: He wrote the   marriage opinion with an eye toward history. ”No union is more profound than marriage, for it embodies the highest ideals of love, fidelity, devotion sacrifice and family,” Kennedy wrote in the opinion joined by the liberals on the bench. ”In forming a marital union, two people become something greater than they once were,” he said and added ”marriage embodies a love that may endure even past death.”  ”Their hope,” Kennedy wrote, ”is not to be condemned to live in loneliness, excluded from one of civilization’s oldest institutions. They ask for equal dignity in the eyes of the law. The Constitution grants them that right.” READ: The best lines from Scalia’s marriage dissent and Kennedy’s decision, Justice Antonin Scalia counterpunched in a blistering dissent. He, too, played a familiar role upbraiding his colleagues for what he saw as a deeply misguided ruling that posed a ”threat to American democracy.” ”The Supreme Court of the United States has descended from the disciplined legal reasoning of John Marshall and Joseph Story to the mystical aphorisms of the fortune cookie,” he wrote in the dissent. But Scalia could only hurl rhetorical grenades. It was ultimately Kennedy’s day. At oral arguments earlier this year, Kennedy expressed concern about changing the definition of marriage that had been around for a ”millennia.” But Friday’s opinion showed no such concerns.  He called marriage ”one of civilization’s oldest institutions” and said that   couples have the right to partake in it and not be ”condemned to live in loneliness.” Kennedy has long stressed the importance of two concepts: state’s rights and individual dignity. In this case where the two concepts were at loggerheads, Kennedy chose dignity. He said the couples ”ask for equal dignity in the eyes of the law” and ” the Constitution grants them that right.” ”Justice Kennedy did what he has done all along since joining the Court    stand up for the equal dignity of all Americans,” said former Acting Solicitor General Neal Katyal who was in the Court to hear the opinion announced. One by one, Kennedy took down the arguments launched by opponents of gay marriage. He rejected claims by the lower court that the issue should be decided by the public process holding that the  ”dynamic of our constitutional system is that individuals need not await the legislative action before asserting a fundamental right.” WATCH: U. S. reacts to   marriage ruling, He went out of his way not to condemn those who are opposed to same sex rights, calling their concerns based on ”decent and honorable religious or philosophical premises” and he added  ”neither they nor their beliefs are disparaged here.” And he rejected a rationale of the States to have marriage ban because it promoted ”responsible procreation” between same sex couples. Kennedy said, ” An ability desire, or promise to procreate is not and has not been a prerequisite for a valid marriage in any state.” Above all, he talked about the children, an issue that deeply concerned him when he wrote to strike a key provision of the Defense of Marriage Act in 2013. ”Without the recognition,” Kennedy wrote then.  The children of same sex couples ”suffer the stigma of knowing their families are somehow lesser.” He said same sex marriage bans ”harm and humiliate the children of same sex couples.” Katyal noted that today’s opinion is the fourth gay rights opinion penned by Kennedy. ”This is the same Justice who led the Court to strike down sodomy bans and laws that targeted gays and lesbians. He read the words above the Supreme Court building ’Equal Justice Under Law,’ and applied them,” Katyal said. Indeed lower courts across the country issued opinions in gay marriage cases citing words that Kennedy had penned in prior decisions. Carrie Severino of the conservative Judicial Crisis Network who is also a former clerk of Justice Thomas, condemned the opinion which she said ”robbed Americans of the opportunity to debate and decide this controversial issue in the public square and short circuited the democratic process.” But she praised the sentiment behind the ruling saying it  offers the opportunity for both sides ”to united in a spirit of respect and dignity, rejecting intimidation against those with different beliefs.” For Elizabeth Wydra, Chief Counsel of the Constitutional Accountability Center and a CNN contributor, Kennedy’s opinion brings the Justice full circle on the most important civil rights issues in decades.  ”With this ruling,” she said, ” Justice Kennedy cemented his legacy as the constitutional champion of gay rights at the Supreme Court.”"
237,"Pope Greets Schwarzenegger, Possible Ambassador to Vatican",2017-01-25,"Pope Francis greeted former California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger Wednesday, just days after the film star’s name had been floated as a possible candidate for U. S. Ambassador to the Holy See. [Schwarzenegger, a Roman Catholic, has been repeatedly criticized by Church figures for his support for abortion and gay marriage, and for state funding of embryonic stem cell research.  Nonetheless, his name began appearing recently in short lists of possible candidates for the office of U. S. Ambassador to the Vatican, an important listening post for the American government. Though Schwarzenegger was married to Maria Shriver in the Catholic Church, after 25 years of marriage the couple split in 2011, although they have yet to finalize their divorce. Schwarzenegger met the Pope Wednesday accompanied by his current girlfriend, physical therapist Heather Milligan. Schwarzenegger is an unlikely candidate for Ambassador to the Holy See.

238,Highlights of Hillary Clinton’s Concession Speech and President Obama’s Remarks - The New York Times,2016-11-09,"Hillary Clinton publicly conceded the election to Donald J. Trump on Wednesday, acknowledging the pain of the defeat in remarks in New York while calling on her supporters to accept that he would be president and give him a chance to lead with an open mind. President Obama, speaking in Washington, also said that he would work to ensure a smooth transition to a Trump administration and that, despite their differences, we are “all rooting for his success. ” Speaker Paul D. Ryan proclaimed that Mr. Trump had achieved a political feat and earned a mandate by reaching new voters. Mr. Ryan said that he was certain that they would work well together on a conservative policy agenda. Global markets swooned overnight but stabilized as investors considered the possibility that Mr. Trump’s mix of policies might bolster the economy.. News of Mr. Trump’s election was met with a mix of shock, uncertainty and some congratulations around the world. • Mrs. Clinton thanked her supporters in her concession speech, and said that she felt pride in the campaign she ran. • Of Mr. Trump, Mrs. Clinton said she hoped that he would be “a successful president for all Americans,” and that she respected and cherished the peaceful transition of power. She told her supporters that they must accept that Mr. Trump would be president. “We owe him an open mind and a chance to lead,” she said. But she also acknowledged that the country was more divided than she had realized. • After a long campaign, Mrs. Clinton acknowledged that the loss cuts deep. “This is painful, and it will be for a long time,” she said. She also expressed regret that she did not shatter the glass ceiling, but said, “Someday, someone will, and hopefully sooner than we might think right now. ” • Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, the Democratic   nominee, who spoke before Mrs. Clinton, said, “I’m proud of Hillary Clinton because she has been and is a great history maker,” pointing to her long career of public service. He saluted her for winning the popular vote in the election, drawing cheers. • Mr. Obama said that he and former President George W. Bush had major differences eight years ago, but they managed a successful transition. He said he expected to do the same with Mr. Trump, while acknowledging that they have their differences, and he invited the   to come to the White House on Thursday. • Mr. Obama reminded the country that we “are all on the same team” and characterized politics as an “intramural scrimmage. ” He said that he was heartened by the conversation that he had with Mr. Trump at 3:30 a. m. and that he hoped Mr. Trump maintains that spirit. • Mr. Obama said that he was proud of Mrs. Clinton, who gave her concession speech on Wednesday just before Mr. Obama spoke, and called her a historic figure. • Mr. Obama called on Americans to move forward with the presumption of good faith in fellow citizens. He said that those who were disappointed should not give up on their dreams. “Sometimes you lose an argument, sometimes you lose an election,” he said, with Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. by his side. “But the path this country has taken has never been a straight line. We zig and zag. ” The Vermont senator, who ran against Mrs. Clinton in the Democratic primary campaign, was silent on the election for most of Wednesday, but in the early evening he offered something of an olive branch to Mr. Trump and acknowledged the middle class anger that he tapped into. “To the degree that Mr. Trump is serious about pursuing policies that improve the lives of working families in this country, I and other progressives are prepared to work with him,” Mr. Sanders said in a statement. But Mr. Sanders maintained that he is opposed to much of what Mr. Trump has stood for and that he will fight any intolerance that he might try to promote as president. “To the degree that he pursues racist, sexist, xenophobic and   policies, we will vigorously oppose him,” Mr. Sanders said. Mr. Ryan congratulated Mr. Trump for accomplishing an “enormous political feat” on Wednesday and said that he was looking forward to working with him to carry forward a Republican policy agenda and prioritize the repeal of the Affordable Care Act. “This health care law is not a popular law,” Mr. Ryan said, adding that Congress had already shown it can get a repeal bill to the president’s desk. “This health care law is collapsing of its own weight. ” That clearly indicated that Republican leaders would use budget rules, called reconciliation, to gut the Affordable Care Act with only a majority of Congress, as they did in January. Senate Democrats would be powerless to filibuster the legislation under the parliamentary rules. Mr. Ryan, who has had differences with Mr. Trump, said that they had spoken twice in the last 18 hours and that he was “very excited” about their ability to work together. “He just earned a mandate,” Mr. Ryan said. The last two Republican presidents gave the next Republican president congratulatory telephone calls on Wednesday. “Laura and I wish the   Melania and the entire Trump family all our very best as they take on an awesome responsibility and begin an exciting new chapter in their lives,” former President George W. Bush said in a statement. Mr. Bush had been critical of Mr. Trump when he was campaigning on behalf of his brother Jeb this year but said that he was rooting for Mr. Trump now. “We pray for the success of our country and the success of our new president,” Mr. Bush said. Mr. Bush’s father, George Bush, the 41st president, also spoke to Mr. Trump on Wednesday. A spokesman said that they talked for about five minutes and that the call was friendly and gracious. “Good luck on your new challenge,” Mr. Bush said. Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor vanquished by Mr. Trump during the Republican primary process, sent Mr. Trump a congratulatory message on Twitter. Dozens of Republican elected officials resisted Mr. Trump’s rise to power, including some who revoked their endorsements in the heat of the general election. Senators like Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and John McCain of Arizona declared Mr. Trump unfit to lead, while ideological conservatives like Ben Sasse of Nebraska and Mike Lee of Utah warned of Mr. Trump’s indifference to the limits of government power. These Trump critics on the right now face a wrenching political choice: to defer to him as the country’s new leader, or to take up a   role against a Republican as he assembles his administration. Since Republicans kept control of the House and Senate, dissenters within Mr. Trump’s party may hold outsize influence over exactly how he can govern as president. Mr. Graham took a reserved approach in his statement on the election on Tuesday, saying that he would aim to help Mr. Trump govern  —   within the bounds of a fairly conventional Republican agenda."
239,American Airlines passenger arrested,2017-05-19," (CNN) A man who caused a disturbance aboard an American Airlines flight from Los Angeles to Honolulu on Friday was detained and will likely face charges, an FBI special agent said. The man, identified as Anil Tuvanc Uskanli    a Turkish national born in    was subdued by crew members and passengers, including an   Los Angeles police officer.  He is expected to face federal charges for interference with a flight crew, FBI special agent Paul Delacourt told reporters. Investigators are still trying to determine the motive behind the disturbance.  Allison Forburger, who lives in Hawaii, where she works for the Navy, said the man was moving toward the   section of the cabin with a blanket over his head when a flight attendant directed him to stop. As the suspect approached the drink cart at the rear of first class, the flight attendant in economy told him, ”Sir, please stop. Sir, I need you to go back to your seat.” Forburger, sitting in an aisle seat at the front of economy class, said other passengers helped the flight attendant get the passenger back toward the back of the plane. The man did not fight with the other passengers and left a black laptop he had been clutching to his chest on the drink cart, she said. The incidents is still under investigation but officials said there were not other threats to the American Airlines or any other aircraft.  No explosives were found on the airplane and the cockpit was not breached, Delacourt said. ’Taped him to his chair’ Passenger Lee Lorenzen told CNN affiliate KITV that the flight attendant told the man: ”You’re not coming in here” and used the cart to block his path. But Forburger said the cart was already in the way as the flight attendants were picking up dishes from   passengers who had just finished lunch. She recalled the crew member saying, ”I need help, I need help, I need to get this guy back to his seat.”  She lost sight of the suspect, but Lorenzen told KITV and CNN affiliate   the man was   to a seat. ”It took seconds,” Lee Lorenzen told  . ”He was pushing against the cart and a bunch of guys grabbed him. They found some duct tape. There were pillows and blankets. And they taped him to his chair.” One of the passengers who helped was an   law enforcement officer, the FBI said. The suspect was met by authorities when the Airbus 321 landed in Honolulu. ”Due to a disturbance during the flight, the crew requested that law enforcement meet the aircraft upon landing in Honolulu,” American Airlines said in a statement. Video from   showed two law enforcement officers escorting a person with hands behind their back off the plane. Incident at LAX, The Department of Homeland Security tweeted that the person was detained and the incident appeared to be isolated. ”At this time, there are no other reports of disruptions to flights,” the department tweeted. We continue to monitor all flights out of an abundance of caution and will provide updates as necessary.” President Donald Trump was also briefed on incident, Trump’s spokesman Sean Spicer said. Earlier, the man, who purchased his ticket around midnight, had an encounter with airport personnel at the airport in Los Angeles, an official briefed on the incident told CNN. The man attempted to use a door   to the public after 3 a. m. PT (6 a. m. ET) while waiting for his flight. The suspect was cleared to fly after that incident.  The airliner left Los Angeles International Airport at 8:43 a. m. PT (11:43 ET) for the nearly   flight, according to FlightAware. com. Two   Raptors from the Hawaiian Air National Guard escorted the plane for the final part of the flight, Navy Cmdr. Dave Benham said."
240,How Big Banks Are Putting Rain Forests in Peril - The New York Times,2017-04-11,"In early 2015, scientists monitoring satellite images at Global Forest Watch raised the alarm about the destruction of rain forests in Indonesia. Environmental groups raced to the scene in West Kalimantan province, on the island of Borneo, to find a charred wasteland: smoldering fires, orangutans driven from their nests, and signs of an extensive release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. “There was pretty much no forest left,” said Karmele Llano Sánchez, director of the nonprofit International Animal Rescue’s orangutan rescue group, which set out to save the endangered primates. “All the forest had burned. ” Fingers pointed to the Rajawali Group, a sprawling local conglomerate known for its ties to powerful politicians like Malaysia’s   prime minister. But lesser known is how some of the world’s largest banks have helped Rajawali  —   and other global agricultural powerhouses  —   expand their plantation empires. The year before the clearing of trees in West Kalimantan, Rajawali’s plantation arm secured $235 million in loans  —   funds that the Indonesian company used to buy out a partner and bolster its landholdings  —   from banks including Credit Suisse and Bank of America, according to an examination of lending data by The New York Times. The deal forms part of at least $43 billion in loans and underwriting to companies linked to deforestation and forest burning in Southeast Asia alone, according to a tally compiled by the   Rainforest Action Network, the Dutch consultancy Profundo and the Indonesian nongovernmental organization TuK Indonesia. More than a third of that sum comes from American, European and Japanese banks, many of which have sustainability pledges that specifically mention deforestation. That figure is almost certainly incomplete because not all financing is made public. It also excludes loans made by the same banks to forestry projects outside Southeast Asia, or financing provided to other, more global players. And it contrasts with efforts by companies like Nestlé and Procter  Gamble to distance themselves from suppliers linked to deforestation. And while there has been a growing movement among endowments and pension funds to divest from the   industry  —   and banks have started to back away from financing coal projects  —   any move away from deforestation has been slower to catch on, experts say. The role of banks has come under the spotlight in recent weeks after environmentalists called out banks like Bank of America and Goldman Sachs for financing the contentious Dakota Access oil pipeline project. The money is aiding a process that scientists say destroys ecosystems, displaces indigenous communities and covers the region each year in a thick, suffocating smog that stretches from Jakarta to Hong Kong. Deforestation  —   and the fires that frequently accompany it  —   also generates   of total global warming emissions, making forestry loss one of the biggest single contributors to global warming, according to the Union of Concerned Scientists. “Destroying the world’s forests makes fighting climate change almost impossible,” said Andrew W. Mitchell, executive director of the Global Canopy Programme, a forestry think tank. “The finance sector is really lagging behind in realizing that. ” In funding Rajawali’s palm oil plantations, the banks appear to have violated their own sustainability policies. In its forestry and agribusiness policy, adopted in 2008, Credit Suisse says it will not finance or advise companies with operations in “primary tropical moist forests” like those of West Kalimantan. Bank of America says in a banking policy, adopted in 2004, that it will not finance commercial projects that result in the clearing of primary tropical moist forests. The 2014 deal financed Rajawali’s expansion into palm oil by helping the conglomerate buy out a former partner, invest in new palm oil mills and increase its landholdings. Demand for palm oil is surging worldwide, driven by rising incomes in markets like China and India and a switch away from trans fats by Americans and Europeans. Rajawali’s plantations have been accused by environmental and labor groups of deforestation and illegal burning. Indonesia is one of the world’s biggest palm oil producers, and forestry loss there and elsewhere ranks as one of the biggest single contributors to global warming. Sebastian Sharp, a spokesman for Rajawali’s plantation arm, acknowledged that the burning and clearing on its West Kalimantan forest sites might be illegal but said local communities encroaching on its properties and starting the fires were to blame. He said the company did not engage in illegal burning or clearing. Credit Suisse declined to comment on its Rajawali deal or to say whether the deal violated its sustainability policies. A Bank of America spokesman, Bill Halldin, said that the most serious accusations against Rajawali came after the 2014 loan, in which the bank played “a very small role. ” “Today, we would certainly consider more information before making any decision on any client,” he said. Brigitte Seegers, a spokeswoman for ABN Amro, declined to comment. Climate concerns have been brought into sharp relief by the impending presidency of Donald J. Trump, who has called climate change a hoax. Mr. Trump has said he will pull the United States out of the Paris accord, a commitment by 195 countries to take concrete measures to reduce   carbon emissions. Daily emissions from Indonesia’s forest fires last year at times exceeded emissions produced by all economic activity in the United States. A recent Harvard and Columbia study estimated that the fires caused at least 100, 000 premature deaths across Southeast Asia. The World Bank estimates that the fires cost Indonesia’s economy $16 billion. Although deforestation has slowed in many parts of the world, notably in the Brazilian Amazon, forest clearing is on the rise in Southeast Asia. Indonesia, in particular, suffers the world’s highest rates of forest loss, an average of almost 2. 1 million acres a year, a study published in 2014 found. About 15 percent of the world’s historical forest cover remains intact, according to the World Resources Institute. The rest has been cleared or degraded or is in fragments. Rajawali originally operated its palm plantation business, Green Eagle Holdings, as a joint venture with the French conglomerate Louis Dreyfus. But starting in 2014, Rajawali took the first step to consolidate the palm oil business under its control, and invest in new infrastructure. Its loans from Western banks were crucial. In January 2014, Green Eagle attracted a $120 million loan from a group of lenders led by ABN Amro. In July of that year, it scored an even bigger loan of $235 million from a syndicate led by Credit Suisse. Bank of America also took part in that loan. The financing allowed Green Eagle to buy out Louis Dreyfus to invest in new palm oil mills and increase its landholdings. In November 2014, Green Eagle merged with another plantation operator, BW Plantation Rajawali is majority shareholder of the resulting company, Eagle High Plantations. The banks issued those loans as Rajawali was being accused of extensive forest and peatland destruction, illegal burning, use of child labor and the use of force against workers at plantations under its control.   mapping by the Indonesian Ministry of Environment and Forestry, and satellite imagery from Global Forest Watch, show forest loss at two sites in West Kalimantan from 2011 to 2013 and again in 2015, with much of the forest gone by the end of the year. Those sites included around 11, 000 hectares of peat, which, when set alight, can smolder for months underground. Zamzami, who goes by one name, a Greenpeace staff member in Indonesia who visited a Rajawali plantation in West Kalimantan in September 2015, said the burning continued. “It was difficult to breathe because of the smoke,” he said in field notes. “Far away, on the horizon, I could see the forest wall. ” Eagle High is now one of Indonesia’s largest palm oil plantation operators, with more than a million acres in land rights under its control, according to an investors’ presentation dated September 2014. Human rights organizations have reported that children as young as 6 work to support their parents in another   plantation in the Papua province. That plantation has promised to support the abolition of child labor by ensuring that there are no children on plantation sites. In December 2015, a    worker was shot dead at the plantation by state security forces. It was unclear why state forces were on private property. Mr. Sharp, the Eagle High spokesman, blamed local villagers for the forest clearing and burning on its sites. “It’s being done by local communities, and we have no control over that,” he said. Environmental groups argue that plantation companies are responsible for protecting their sites. Mr. Sharp said that there were instances in which workers brought their children to plantations but that the company was “trying to brainstorm ways in which we can stop them from doing that. ” He also questioned the wisdom of Indonesian labor law. “Why can’t we hire children at 15? Families need income,” he said. Under the country’s law, the minimum age for hazardous work, including jobs on plantations, is 18. The worker who was killed, Marvel Doga, was “drunk and violent, poured petrol everywhere and threatened to set fire, and he had with him a bow and arrow” when nearby state security forces tried to incapacitate him, leading to his death, Mr. Sharp said. He said Eagle High paid “thousands of dollars” to his family in compensation. Credit Suisse and ABN Amro declined to discuss specific deals. Bank of America declined to comment on the accusations. But in a February 2015 research note, Credit Suisse deemed Rajawali’s palm oil push a success. Eagle High’s increased landholdings and land rights signaled “significant headroom for expansion” of palm oil production, Priscilla Tjitra, an equity analyst for the bank, said in a report to clients. “The allocation of finance is so influential in our economy and to our environment,” said Tom Picken of the Rainforest Action Network. “But there’s little way we can hold financial sectors to account. ” The orangutan rescues continue. The world has lost 60 percent of its population of Bornean orangutans since 1950, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature. In July, the Bornean orangutan was listed as critically endangered. International Animal Rescue, which runs a temporary shelter for about 100 orangutans in West Kalimantan, said its staff had rescued roughly 50 of the primates during the 2015 burning season, twice the number the organization rescues in an average year. “They were all starving, all skinny,” said Ms. Sánchez, the orangutan rescue group’s director. So far this year, about 25 orangutans have been rehabilitated. “The problem is that every time an area is destroyed and orangutans are under real threat, we have to look for areas to release them, and that’s challenging,” she said. “We’re running out of places where we can release these orangutans. ” In September, Rajawali’s plantation arm secured a $192 million loan from Bank Negara Indonesia, a state bank, to refinance the debt held by its plantation subsidiaries and to double the capacity of palm oil refineries in Papua and West Kalimantan. Bank Negara Indonesia’s sustainability policies say that its clients must adopt “minimum environmental, social and governance standards. ” The bank did not respond to requests for comment."
241,Obama’s Trip to Havana Triggers Personal Pain in Cuban-Americans - Breitbart,2016-03-21,"Columnist Dan Le Batard writes about his personal feelings towards President Obama’s trip to Cuba at the Miami Herald:[Another loss. That’s what this already feels like to so much of Miami, before the “historic” baseball game has even been played. As if the Cubans who fled to this country haven’t already felt enough of those losses over the decades. Lost childhoods. Lost roots. Lost families. Lost land. Lost freedoms. Lost lives in the ocean that divides Cuba and America like the million miles of distance between desperation and hope. So much happy coverage on the television this week. Historic visit! America and Baseball celebrating themselves. Obama and Jeter and ESPN head toward communism like it is another cruise port, so many symbols of Americana descending on a rotting island stuck in the 1950s, and it doesn’t feel quite right back in Miami, like watching a funeral morph into a party. The history of my own people feels like it is either being ignored or trampled here, and I’m not quite sure which of those feels worse. Read the full story at the Miami Herald."
242,Palestinian Terrorist’s Wife to Address Clinton Foundation,2016-09-20,"Donald Trump is criticizing Hillary Clinton over the fact that the Clinton Foundation is honoring a Palestinian teacher whose husband is a convicted terrorist on Tuesday evening. [Hanan   is scheduled to speak at a Clinton Global Initiative event in New York after winning a $1 million teaching award from another charity that donates to the Clinton Foundation. Her husband, Omar   spent 10 years in an Israeli prison for his role in a 1980 bombing that killed six Israelis.  The event is going ahead as planned, in spite of the recent Islamist terrorist bombings in New York and New Jersey, which injured dozens. The Wall Street Journal noted Tuesday: Omar   was convicted on charges that he was an accomplice in a deadly bombing attack in Hebron that killed Israelis walking home from Friday night Sabbath prayers. According to an Associated Press account at the time, Omar   was a chemist who provided chemicals needed for making the bombs. Trump campaign spokesman Jason Miller said: Today’s report that the Clinton Foundation is feting the wife of a Palestinian man convicted of helping bomb innocent Israeli citizens is deeply disturbing, especially in the wake of this weekend’s attacks. The decision to honor the wife of a terrorist by Hillary Clinton’s foundation shows a complete lack of judgment and a callousness that should disqualify her from holding the presidency. The Republican National Committee has also reportedly objected. The biography for Hanan   on the Clinton Foundation website does not mention the terror connection: Winner of the 2016 Global Teacher Prize, an initiative of the Varkey Foundation, Hanan Al Hroub grew up in the Palestinian refugee camp, Bethlehem, where she was regularly exposed to acts of violence. She went into primary education after her children were left deeply traumatized by a shooting incident they witnessed on their way home from school. Her experiences in meetings and consultations to discuss her children’s behavior, development and academic performance in the years that followed led Al Hroub to try to help others who, having grown up in similar circumstances, require special handling at school. With so many troubled children in the region, Palestinian classrooms can be tense environments. Al Hroub embraces the slogan “No to Violence” and uses a specialized teaching approach she developed herself. Al Hroub has shared her perspective at conferences, meetings and teacher training seminars. The Clinton Foundation responded by producing a statement from Democrat   Haim Saban, who also supports   causes, in support of the event and of Hroub’s work as a teacher. Joel B.

243,BBC Radio Drama Gave Tips For Illegal Migrants In Somalia,2016-03-27,"A BBC department that produced a radio drama giving practical tips to   migrants on how to cross from Somalia to Europe received nearly £90 million of British tax payers’ money. [The drama, broadcast to Somalia and Kenya at the height of the migrant crisis, featured one character advising a woman to travel only with small luggage to make the illegal crossing easier.  Another character is later advised that “this current time is the best opportunity to reach Europe”. The drama is produced by BBC Media Action, the broadcaster’s charitable arm, which is funded by the British government’s foreign aid budget. Titled ‘A Better Life than Today’ it follows the fortunes of a group of Somali youths and has more than two million listeners on BBC Radio Somali. Although some characters do warn against illegal immigration, a constant theme of the drama is the longing for a better, more prosperous life in Europe. In one episode, a woman asks a friend: “So what do the women who make the journey  …     look like?” Her friend responds: “They carry large suitcases! I would advise you to carry a small bag with a few items  …     If you have long hair, cut it shorter. You won’t have anywhere to brush it  …     whatever is difficult will end up being easy. ” The   migrant responds: “What am I scared of? I, too, must go there. ” A man later tells a young woman: ‘This current time is the best opportunity to reach Europe  …     when the seas are calm. All in all, migration can change your life.’ Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen told the Mail on Sunday: “If the BBC have been involved in a UK   programme which has in some way encouraged emigration to the UK and Europe from Africa, that would be seen as highly inappropriate with the current migrant crisis. ” A spokesman for the government responded: “It is entirely wrong to suggest that this programme is urging Somalis to migrate in fact one of its central messages is about the dangers of migration. ” This is just the latest problem to hit Britain’s increasingly controversial foreign aid budget. Earlier this year, campaigners urged the government to stop giving foreign aid to countries where Christian persecution is rife, fearing the money only helps the oppressors. Christian charity Open Doors documented the rise of   persecution across Africa and the Middle East and produced a list of 50 most dangerous countries for Christians. CEO Lisa Pearce highlighted the fact the majority of these countries receive substantial amounts of funding from the UK. “We have influence. We must not sit on the sidelines while Christianity is quietly eroded around the world,” she said."
244,Family of Murdered Woman Sues San Francisco over ’Sanctuary City’,2016-05-27,"The family of Kathryn Steinle filed a federal lawsuit on Friday against San Francisco and other government agencies  —   just days after the city   its “sanctuary city” policy to shelter illegal aliens, including criminals, from deportation. [The    Steinle was walking with her father on San Francisco’s Pier 14 last July 1 when she was shot and killed by an illegal alien, Juan Francisco   who had already been convicted of seven felonies and deported five times to Mexico.  According to the local CBS News affiliate in San Francisco, the lawsuit “names the city of San Francisco, former Sheriff Ross Mirkarimi, the U. S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and U. S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement” and “alleges that officials allowed Juan Francisco   an undocumented immigrant with a history of drug offenses, to go free and obtain the gun that killed her. ” The family’s lawyer said: “The Steinle Family hopes that their actions today will serve to highlight the lax enforcement of gun safety regulations among the law enforcement agencies involved and bureaucratic confusion so that this will not happen to others. ” According to the Los Angeles Times, the lawsuit largely focuses on a memorandum issued in March 2015 by   Ross Mirkarimi, in which Mirkarimi prevented local authorities from communicating with federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) about detainees. Mirkarimi was replaced by the voters. The new sheriff, Vicki Hennessy, promised to expand the city’s cooperation with federal officials. However, she was opposed by the San Francisco Board of Supervisors and local amnesty activists, who dismissed Steinle’s death as a mere unfortunate occurrence. They placed the blame at the feet of the BLM, from which the murder weapon was stolen. (The BLM is named in the lawsuit.) On Tuesday, the Board of Supervisors approved a compromise in which local authorities would be permitted to contact ICE in  cases where an inmate “has been convicted of a serious felony in the past five years or has been convicted of three felonies in specified state penal codes, such as robbery or assault with a deadly weapon, arising out of three separate incidents in the past five years,” the San Francisco Examiner reported. Other crimes, including some felonies, would still not result in an inmate being reported to ICE. Hennessy acknowledged that the new sanctuary city policy would not have saved Kate Steinle. The Steinle family has also expressed disappointment at being unable to convince Congress to pass “Kate’s Law,” which would prevent similar occurrences in the future by applying mandatory   sentences to illegal aliens who are deported and return illegally to the U.

What is it? The leaks. Yes, leaks. There is a leaker in the White House. There is a traitor inside the people’s house  —   a traitor who must be taken out.

246,A Singer’s Journey: From Solitary Confinement to the Met Opera - The New York Times,2017-03-06,"It was roughly 15 years ago that a high school student from Virginia named Ryan Speedo Green first visited the Metropolitan Opera on a school trip. At the time, he was working to put his life back on track after a rough childhood that included a harrowing two months in juvenile detention. But he set himself an unlikely goal. “I am going to sing at the Met,” he told one of his teachers. And he did. The story of his leap from solitary confinement to opera’s grandest stage is the subject of a book released this month, “Sing for Your Life: A Story of Race, Music, and Family,” by Daniel Bergner. And on Wednesday night, Mr. Green, now a      with a burgeoning international career, was back at the Met, basking in bravos and tossed flowers after singing his biggest role there yet: Colline, the poor philosopher in Puccini’s “La Bohème. ” In his review in The New York Times, James R. Oestreich called Mr. Green “the real showstopper” and described his big moment  —   a   ode to a beloved overcoat he plans to pawn to help his friends  —   as “immensely touching. ” Backstage after the curtain calls, Mr. Green greeted some of the people who had helped him get there. There was Betty Hughes, who had taught him in an elementary school class made up of the most troubled children in his district, and who had not given up on him when he hurled his desk in anger on the first day. There was her husband, Leon, who ran the arts high school in Norfolk, Va. where Mr. Green studied singing. And there was Denyce Graves, the   who sang the title role in the Met performance of “Carmen” that he had heard on that high school trip  —   his introduction to opera. “You changed my entire life,” Mr. Green, who now stands    and has a rich, resonant voice both when he speaks and when he sings, told her. That Ms. Graves was   like him, had first given Mr. Green the idea that he, too, could sing opera one day. She had received his class warmly when they visited her backstage, in the same room where he was now embracing her. It was a heady capstone to a major month for Mr. Green. His life story and the new book about it have been featured in recent days by “CBS This Morning,” NPR’s “Fresh Air,” and a range of newspapers including The Washington Post and The New York Post. The book, which grew out of a 2011 article that Mr. Bergner wrote for The New York Times Magazine, recounts in unsparing detail Mr. Green’s difficult childhood and family life, including his time in juvenile detention at the age of 12 for threatening his mother and brother, parts of which were spent in solitary confinement. “I’ll never forget that moment,” Mr. Green said in an interview, of being taken from his family’s home. “They shackled me, put me in   shackles, and carried me out of the house as I was fighting to get back into my house. ” But the book describes how he went on to turn his life around, and how, with the help of dedicated teachers, he painstakingly learned to sing opera: getting two music degrees winning the Met’s prestigious National Council Auditions in 2011 joining its demanding Lindemann Young Artist Development Program, where he had to make up for lost time in a field where many singers receive training from early childhood and joining the Vienna State Opera as a member of the ensemble. “There can be competition between singers,” Dominique Meyer, the director of the Vienna State Opera, said in an interview. “But Ryan Speedo Green came into the ensemble, and I think everyone loved him from the first day. ” Sharing the painful, personal stories in the book had helped Mr. Green begin to come to terms with his history. “It was somewhat therapeutic,” he said, “because for so long I’d put my past behind me. ” He said that he hoped that by sharing his story, he might inspire troubled children and their families, as well as the teachers and professionals who work with them. He has started to advocate for more funding for children’s mental health and returned with Mr. Bergner to speak with children in the detention center where he was held. He plans to go back in December. “I want them to know this is not the end,” he said, “because if I can do it, you kids surely can do it. ” Mr. Bergner said that when he began the book there had been no guarantee that Mr. Green’s career would take off. But he said that Mr. Green had by then come so far that it was already an uplifting story. “I was just constantly stunned by the level of sheer will that it must have taken him,” Mr. Bergner said. “Coming out of that institution at the age of 12, living in a trailer park, with just no direction offered on how to transform himself  —   and yet he did. ” The book also offers a candid look at race in the opera world. Mr. Green describes the pain he has felt when, after singing arias by Verdi, Puccini or Mozart, white audiences regularly ask him at recitals or parties to sing “Ol’ Man River. ” He said that at a moment when the nation was confronting issues of race in so many areas, it was important to speak frankly about it in classical music. “I think it’s important to put race at the forefront if you can,” he said. “Because without talking about it, you can’t change anything. ” Mr. Green, who started out in very small roles, has been working his way up to bigger  —   if still mostly modest  —   ones, like the assassin Sparafucile in “Rigoletto” and the vengeful Commendatore in “Don Giovanni. ” He noted that at 30, he is still young for a   and still working to establish himself in a tough field. But when Mr. Bergner, researching the book, showed him logs that the juvenile facility had kept on him, Mr. Green said it was staggering to reflect on them. “If I read that, and you asked me, ‘Where is this kid now? ’” he said, “I would never tell you they probably have two degrees and have a wife and are living in Europe and are singing at the Metropolitan Opera. ”"
247,Manchester bee tattoos honor bombing victims,2017-05-27,"Manchester (CNN) As Manchester heals after the suicide bombing that claimed 22 lives on Monday, people lay flowers at makeshift memorials around the city. Some people write messages in chalk on the ground, which disappear in the rain, only to be replaced hours later with new messages of grief and love. Other people have lined up for hours, choosing to remember the victims by getting something for life     a tattoo of a bee. The bee has long been the symbol of Manchester, symbolizing a ”hive of activity” in an industrial city. Now it’s a symbol of those lost, of strength and of the city’s unity. The Manchester Tattoo Appeal was started by tattoo artist Sam Barber to show solidarity with those affected by the attack and to raise money for them and their families. Those getting tattooed were asked to donate 50 pounds ($64). Barber said the bee was the ”obvious choice as a symbol of strength” for ”the city that has always stuck together.” And she said people just have to look around Manchester this weekend to see that no one is hiding in fear. Outside the city, the idea behind the tattoo spread quickly across social media, bringing the bee beyond Manchester and the United Kingdom. Barber said tattoo parlors in places such as Canada, Australia and America also picked up the template and were inking the bee. Barber’s crowdfunding page had already raised nearly 30, 000 pounds by Saturday night, and many parlors were raising their own funds to be added to the appeal. Organizers described an ”overwhelming response” from studios around the world. Over the past few days, people have had to be turned away as parlors struggled to keep up with demand. Some parlors were starting to keep their doors open until 2 a. m. to make sure everyone who wants to can be inked. At Stingin Ink in Bolton, just northwest of Manchester, the parlor’s owner, Paul Taylor, was doing the bee tattoos in a conveyor belt fashion. He said he’d already tattooed hundreds of people and expected the demand to continue for the next few weeks. If customers can’t afford the 50 pounds, Taylor said he’d charge them less to make sure they can still get the tattoo. Customers waited in line at Stingin Ink for hours. Yet, despite the long wait and the pain of the tattoo, people chatted and laughed. There was a sense that people were happy to be doing anything they could to help, to come together to remember the victims and send a message of unity. A family came to get tattoos together and waited in line for three hours. For the daughter, Poppy, it was her first tattoo. Despite being apprehensive about the pain she said the tattoo and donation felt like the right thing to do, and that she wanted to look at her tattoo in 30 years’ time and know she did her part to help. Her sentiment was reflective of the mood in Manchester in the week following the attack. The city has stood bravely, united, and    perhaps most admirably    kindly."
248,Iowa State University Attempts To Censor MILO Event With Security Fee Hike - Breitbart,2016-11-30,"The administration at Iowa State University is trying to torpedo an upcoming event featuring Breitbart News senior editor MILO by demanding student organizers pay nearly $2, 000 in security fees at the last minute. [“I had paid in full September 7th an amount of $1070 out of my own pocket, which including the rental space, lighting, AV, tech, and the whole shabang” explained the student organizer in an email to Breitbart Tech. “Just yesterday, the event manager at ISU said the ISUPD is requiring 6 officers to secure the rental space which will cost additional but did not say amount. Today, the event manager sent out an email saying it will require an additional $1944”.  In response to the raised security fee imposed by college administrators, the student organizer attempted to raise money to cover the extra costs, and managed to raise just over $500 from fellow students —   leaving $1444 left to be raised. “As far as I can tell, no liberal events even required additional security let alone any at all” continued the organizer. “There is rarely any conservatives events that are held so its pretty obvious they are trying to cancel this event. ” After all the preparation they pull a move like this” he continued. “Where the heck is a college student going to get almost 2 grand a week before an event happens. ” By imposing excessive fees on student groups, administrators at the University of Maryland are likely violating a 1992 Supreme Court ruling, which decided that public universities can not impose security fees based upon their perception of how attendees may react to the event. In Forsyth County v. Nationalist Movement (1992) the Supreme Court determined that government actors —  like public college or university administrators —  may not lawfully impose security fees based on their own subjective judgments about “the amount of hostility likely to be created by the speech based on its content. ” Such fees amount to a tax on speech an administrator subjectively dislikes, or subjectively believes is likely to cause disruption or violence. Several universities have previously raised security fees in an attempt to derail MILO’s talks at universities around the United States, including the University of Maryland, where a MILO event was cancelled under similar circumstances in October. Minnesota State University, where MILO is due to visit on the 15th of December, has also placed an extra security fee on the event, demanding “double the recommended security presence” and “double the funds. ”"
249,Now 41 US military members have contracted Zika,2016-08-03,"Washington (CNN) CNN has learned there are now 41 members of the military who have been diagnosed with the Zika virus since testing began earlier this year. Eight new cases have been recorded in the last week, a Pentagon official told CNN. One of the military service members is a pregnant female. Under Pentagon health policies, female service members are permitted to move out of countries where Zika exists. In addition, a senior State Department official told CNN there have been two confirmed Zika cases among US diplomats serving overseas. The diplomats were serving in countries where Zika has already been contracted.  The military tracks the number of cases reported among the ranks each week. Earlier Wednesday, the number stood at 33, but a new update has now been provided. In addition, seven military dependents have been diagnosed with Zika, an increase of one case since the previous week. The Pentagon said that all the exposures happened outside the US, but some of those who have had it or may currently have it may be in the United States, as there is no quarantine for Zika. Even before the update, number of confirmed Zika cases in the US military nearly doubled in the last month. On June 29 there were 18 cases. Military and diplomatic personnel are advised to follow the same rules as civilians to protect themselves in   areas, such as wearing appropriate clothing and using insect repellant. The Army is collaborating with outside partners to develop a Zika virus vaccine, according to the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research. Walter Reed is working with Sanofi Pasteur, a major vaccines developer and manufacturer."

251,Olympics: Brazil loses to Sweden on penalties in women’s football semifinal,2016-08-16,"Rio de Janeiro (CNN) After two hours of near constant shrieking and wailing, the vast Maracana Stadium fell silent. Brazil had suffered soccer heartbreak again. Two years after its men’s team was humiliated   by Germany in a World Cup semifinal, its women lost an agonizing penalty shootout against Sweden to exit at the same stage of the Olympic competition. During 120 minutes of play, the air in this grand old arena crackled with an anxious mix of nervousness and expectation. And at the end of an exhausting, goalless contest, it was Andressa who endured the agony of missing the decisive penalty. Read: Rio 2016 Day 11   Live, After Sweden’s Lisa Dahlkvist found the back of the net to send her country into Saturday’s gold medal match, memories of past failing came flooding back for Brazil’s weary fans. This defeat is another ghost that will haunt the Maracana, a venue built for Brazil’s hosting    and, it was assumed, winning    of the 1950 men’s World Cup, only for Uruguay to spoil its party. Now its the Swedes who have dealt a crushing blow to this country’s   public. Germany await them in the final. Led by its captain Marta, the No. 10 with flecks of gold in her ponytail and magic in her boots, Brazil couldn’t find a way past a Sweden team it had beaten   during the tournament’s group stage. At the conclusion of this match, Marta was left on the floor in tears. At the age of 30, she might not get another shot at gold. But Sweden showed the same steel which saw it get the better of   favorites the US in the previous round. ”We feel horrible about the defeat,” said Brazil’s coach Vadao. ”We dominated the game and the strategy of the Swedes was what we expected and they played well. ”There were few chances and, though we had control of the game, we had few opportunities and we know what happened in the penalties.” Once the shock of defeat had sunk in, Brazil’s players were cheered from the field by a crowd which booed heartily during each of Sweden’s five penalties.  ”Playing at this wonderful stadium. I can only say frustration, no other way,” he added. ”I will not apologize as we did dominate the match and tried to find the best way to score.  ”Through the whole 120 minutes we did try our best, we tried everything, that’s why it is so frustrating.” Olympic football success is something Brazil craves. It’s the only major honor its men’s team is yet to win. All eyes will now fall on the men’s team, who play Honduras at the same stadium on Wednesday. And the form of Neymar and his teammates is making its fans nervous. Despite a   win over Colombia in the quarterfinals, Brazil was held to   draws by Iraq and South Africa during the group stage. Victory over Honduras could set up a heavyweight final with Germany, which plays Nigeria. ”Since we lost to Germany, we don’t really have hope,” Bruno Ditommazi, a    Brazilian from Sao Paulo who now lives in the UK, told CNN outside of the stadium. ”We can go to the final against Germany which is going to be trouble for us!” What better way to exorcise those ghosts?"
252,"Obama Announces Executive Gun Control, Taunts Congress for Inaction",2016-01-05,"After being introduced on January 5 by Mark Barden —  parent of a    student who was killed with the guns Adam Lanza stole, then used to attack Sandy Hook —  President Obama stood at the White House podium and announced a summary list of executive gun controls to lessen “mass violence” in America. [Obama began by referencing a number of shootings, and although he did not mention it, the vast majority of gunmen involved in these shootings passed background checks to acquire their firearms. The shootings included San Bernardino, Fort Hood, the Aurora movie theater, the Wisconsin Sikh Temple, the Charleston church, and others.  He then focused on the January 8, 2011, shooting of Gabby Giffords in Tucson, Arizona. Ironically, although Obama did not mention it, Giffords’ attacker, Jared Loughner, passed a background check to acquire his gun, as well. Obama decried violence in America, saying, “We are the only advanced country on earth that see this kind of mass violence erupt with this kind of frequency. It doesn’t happen in other advanced countries. It’s not even close. ” And he lamented that the push to expand background checks was introduced right after the Sandy Hook attack but was defeated because it became “a partisan issue. ” He said expanded background checks are “common sense reforms” and there is no reason to oppose them. Obama said there ought not be different rules for retail gun sellers and private gun sellers —  that one rule should apply to everyone. He admitted that such expansion “might not have stopped the last massacre, or the one before that, or the one before that,” but he said that is no reason to keep from doing something. And in a strange digression, he talked about mass stabbings in China —  and how mass stabbings do not cost as many lives because the attackers lack “powerful weapons. ” Amid loud applause, Obama eventually turned his attention to his executive gun controls. He said anyone considered in the business of selling guns must get a license: “It doesn’t matter whether you’re doing it over the Internet or at a gun show. ” He stressed expanding background checks to cover trusts and said the government is hiring more FBI personnel to do background checks faster and bring the background check system into the 21st century. The President said he wants to “add 200 more ATF agents and investigators,” add new regulations and reporting requirements to existing Federal Firearms License holders (FFLs) remove barriers that prevent states from reporting mental health information to the NICS system, and improve mental health treatment. He then turned to “smart guns,” stating he wants to boost gun safety technology. “Many gun deaths are the result of guns that were stolen, misused, or fired accidentally,” he said. Thus, he proposed setting guns up so they operate like a phone, with guns disabled from firing without the right code. He did not explain how a single mother or a   female facing assault from a serial attacker is supposed to remember the code they must enter to make their   weapons operable under duress. Obama strung together a number of concluding comments, many of which were   taunting Congress for not passing gun control and comments that praised businesses that practice certain aspects of gun control by choice, rather than government mandate. For example, he praised retailers who are refusing to sell   firearms and “high capacity” magazines, and said he hopes other retailers will make this decision, as well. Obama said that we all must “demand a Congress brave enough to stand up to the gun lobby’s lies. ” Follow AWR Hawkins on Twitter: @AWRHawkins. Reach him directly at awrhawkins@breitbart. com."

S. university campuses has started off with a bang. His first event, at Rutgers University in New Jersey, was disrupted by feminists and Black Lives Matter protesters, who chanted slogans and smeared fake blood on their faces before storming out of the auditorium. [Yiannopoulos had been invited by the Young Americans For Liberty at Rutgers to speak on “How the Progressive Left Is Destroying Education. ” The event drew a huge crowd, with the line of students waiting to enter the venue stretching around campus. It’s the first stage of Yiannopoulos “Dangerous Faggot Tour,” a series of speeches by the Breitbart Tech editor on U. S campuses, which have become hotbeds of   radicalism in recent months.

Peaceful attendees who had come to hear a speech instead found themselves splashed with the fake blood. At least one attendee was allegedly assaulted by a protester, who covered him in red paint.  The protests continued outside: After the protesters left the auditorium, the event continued with Yiannopoulos taking questions from the audience, who later queued up for autographs and photos with the Breitbart Tech editor. In contrast to the activists, Yiannopoulos’ supporters conducted themselves peacefully for the rest of the evening.  Picture credit: www. heatley. nyc (@nevheatley3) Event organiser Aviv Khavich, who was hit by some of the protesters’ red paint, hailed the event as a success despite the incident. We knew from the   that there would be protests. That wasn’t a surprise. Milo is obviously a very controversial character and protests sort of come as a given. What we didn’t expect was the sheer level of unruly chaos that the protesters brought, or that so many of them would be able to make it into the audience. We didn’t expect them to cover themselves, the building and others in red paint to protest some vague idea of Milo being “hateful. ” They were misinformed, if at all informed, on Milo’s stances, and they were incredibly unwise in their choice of action. The event was obviously a huge success. The protests brought even larger publicity, and there were at least a thousand people milling about Scott Hall last night. Fans, protesters, police, the press. An admin from KnowYourMeme even showed up. Milo got shouted over a bunch, which was unfortunate, but it really served to just prove exactly the purpose of his speech: modern leftism is poisoning debate and thought at universities. You can’t even bring a harmless gay man to speak without an enormous shouting match erupting. Black Lives Matter will not benefit from this appearance, just like they did not benefit from their poor exhibition at the Dartmouth library. People are going to see them for the vitriolic hate group they are —  they were assaulting people, harassing people, vandalizing the walls and floors. ” “We’re going to see a lot of people intellectually disowning BLM after this event. So, yes Milo at Rutgers was a huge leap for free speech and for challenging progressivism on university campuses.

254,"White House, Trump object to Kaepernick views of US",2016-08-29,"Washington (CNN) Both the White House and Donald Trump objected Monday to views expressed by NFL star Colin Kaepernick about the treatment of minorities in the US. The quarterback said over the weekend he would not stand for the traditional playing of the ”Star Spangled Banner” ahead of a   game against the Green Bay Packers. He said afterward he refuses to ”show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color.” ”To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder,” he told NFL Media. But while President Barack Obama’s spokesman said Kaepernick was free to sit in protest during the national anthem if he chooses, Trump scoffed the player ”should find a country that works better for him.”  The Republican presidential candidate told radio host Dori Monson the anthem protest was a ”terrible thing.” ”Let him try,” the Republican presidential candidate told Monson, BuzzFeed first reported, adding the episode was a ”terrible thing.” White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest, meanwhile, said that while he didn’t agree with Kaepernick’s views on race there was no offense in airing his grievances. ”I certainly don’t share the views that Mr. Kaepernick expressed after the game in explaining his reasoning for his actions. But we surely all acknowledge and even defend his right to express those views in the settings that he chooses,” Earnest said. ”That’s what he has done. Even as objectionable as we find his perspective, he certainly is entitled to express them.” Earnest said he was ”confident” that Obama was aware of the issue, but said he hadn’t spoken to the president directly about Kaepernick’s protest."

[Falwell said Trump is “a successful executive and entrepreneur, a wonderful father and a man who I believe can lead our country to greatness again. ”  The Washington Post reports the endorsement represents: “the blessing of one of the evangelical community’s biggest names just days before the Iowa caucuses. ” “It is truly an honor to receive Jerry’s endorsement. Not only is he a   person, with a wonderful family, whom I have great respect for  —   I also consider him a very good friend and his support means so much to me,” Trump said of the endorsement."
256,Is Donald Trump taking North Korea’s bait?,2017-04-25,"Washington (CNN) North Korea put on a   display of artillery power Tuesday to mark a national holiday and thumb its nose at US President Donald Trump’s declaration that the country has ”gotta behave.” Pyongyang staged the pounding display of large caliber guns used in land warfare    perhaps a reminder that Seoul and its US military base lie within easy reach    shortly after detaining an American teacher, the third US citizen held by the regime.  The US staged its own response, beginning joint naval drills in the region with South Korea and Japan as the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson moved toward the Korean Peninsula and one of the most powerful submarines in the American arsenal arrived in South Korea    part of an ”armada” the US was sending to the region, Trump told the Fox Business Network in  .  On Wednesday, the White House will hold an unusual briefing about the Hermit Kingdom, with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Defense Secretary James Mattis and other officials outlining the threat for the entire Senate. On Friday, Tillerson will host a meeting on North Korea at the UN. And on Monday, Trump called on visiting UN ambassadors to apply more sanctions on Pyongyang.  Tensions surrounding North Korea, long on the rise, have risen sharply since Trump took office. Pyongyang has continued its pursuit of nuclear weapons and the missile capability to deliver a bomb as far as the continental US, even as the new president has declared the status quo is ”unacceptable.”  Trump is making a   effort to get China to pressure the rogue regime into compliance, declaring that if Beijing doesn’t do something, ”we will.” North Korea responded in a statement Tuesday, slamming the ”ridiculous and foolhardy” Trump administration for taking steps that are ”little short of lighting the fuse of a total war under the present    situation on the Korean Peninsula.”  The statement, attributed to a Foreign Ministry spokesman and using the acronym for the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, said that ”the root causes of pushing the DPRK to have access to nukes” included US attempts to isolate them internationally along with ”the nuclear threat” the US has posed to North Korea for ”more than half a century.” The DPRK will stand against the US and ”cut the windpipe of the US imperialists by dint of the strong revolutionary forces with the nuclear force, an almighty treasured sword, as their pivot,” the statement said.   The growing danger has alarmed observers, analysts and lawmakers alike, in part because all attempts by former administrations to stop or slow the North Korean program through sanctions, aid, talks and attempts to draw Pyongyang into the world community have failed. North Korea is expected to conduct a sixth nuclear test imminently.  ”Kim Jong Un’s regime has thrown its full weight behind its quest for nuclear weapons and the means to deliver them,” John McCain, an Arizona Republican and chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said Tuesday. ”And unfortunately, the regime is making real progress.”  ”A North Korean missile with a nuclear payload capable of striking an American city is no longer a distant hypothetical, but an imminent danger    one that poses a real and rising risk of conflict,” McCain said.  Kim’s steady progress and his ability to wreak havoc on South Korea and Japan with the missiles and weapons he already has means there are few good options beyond the pursuit of more sanctions    which Trump called for Monday during a White House meeting with ambassadors from the UN Security Council. ”The council must be prepared to impose additional and stronger sanctions on North Korean nuclear and ballistic missile programs,” Trump said.  His other options    ones used by previous administrations    include pressure, diplomacy and deterrence. Trump moved quickly on the diplomacy front, sending Mattis and Tillerson to Asia, while two of the President’s first visitors were Chinese President Xi Jinping and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.  And on the pressure and deterrence fronts, Trump is pushing to get more help from China, Pyongyang’s main protector. It’s a strategy that critics and supporters endorse even as they express doubts about how committed China is. ”Engaging with China and making this more their problem than our problem is the only path forward that I see in the short term,” Senator Chris Coons, a Delaware Democrat, said on MSNBC Tuesday.  But the increasingly tough rhetoric about North Korea isn’t helping, according to some experts. Trump’s tough talk has been echoed by those who back the idea of a muscular response to North Korea. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican who sits on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said Tuesday that ”if you’re North Korea and you’re betting that Donald Trump is all talk and no action, you’re making a big mistake.”  Earlier in the day, Graham had Tweeted that ”Pres @realDonaldTrump is NOT going to let the nutjob in North Korea develop a missile    with a nuclear weapon on top    that can hit the US.”  On Monday, the President spoke about North Korean leader Kim Jong Un at a reception for conservative media outlets, saying, ”I’m not so sure he’s so strong like he says he is, I’m not so sure at all.” The comment, experts said, would almost certainly get under the    dictator’s skin.  ”It’s been all about pressure and brinksmanship and military tools and tactics and ( ) and now to literally, directly taunt the leader of North Korea is like poking the hornet’s nest yet again,” said Paul Carroll, program director at the Ploughshares Fund, a group working to eliminate nuclear weapons. Experts like Carroll and others warn that North Korea, which celebrated the 85th anniversary of its founding Tuesday, would see the US rhetoric as a threat and, coupled with the increased US military activity in the region, could be provoked into action.  The Michigan, the powerful nuclear submarine that docked in the South Korean port city of Busan Tuesday, can be armed with 154 conventional cruise missiles, the same type of missiles the US launched against Syria several weeks ago, and is capable of supporting special operations. US defense officials described the port call as a show of force amid the rising tensions.  ”If you do this kind of ratcheting (up) of rhetorical tensions but also sending military hardware into the region, if you do that absent of any kind of offramp or door or window for the North Koreans to consider walking through and reengaging in any sort of discussions, bad things are going to happen,” Carroll said. Seoul, with its population of about 10 million people, lies within 35 miles of the border with North Korea, which has the world’s largest standing army of more than 1. 2 million active soldiers and plenty of conventional weaponry that puts the South Korean capital within reach.  And there are handy US targets as well. North Korea said on Sunday it was ready to sink Trump’s armada.  ”Our revolutionary forces are   to sink a US nuclear powered aircraft carrier with a single strike,” said a commentary in the paper of the country’s ruling Workers’ Party. The Rodong Sinmun newspaper compared the USS Carl Vinson to a ”gross animal” and said a strike on the aircraft carrier would ”show our military’s force.” "
257,Malta hijackers surrender after releasing Libyan passengers,2016-12-23," (CNN) Two hijackers surrendered Friday, hours after forcing a Libyan plane to land in Malta and threatening to blow up the aircraft. Authorities did not say whether the pair had made any demands. But one waved a green flag outside the aircraft, suggesting loyalty to the late Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi. Afriqiyah Airways Flight 8U209 was en route to the Libyan capital of Tripoli with 111 passengers aboard when hijackers diverted the plane. Latest developments, • All passengers and crew members on board were released. They returned to Libya early Saturday, according to Malta’s national security minister, Carmelo Abela. • The hijackers are being interrogated, Malta’s Prime Minister says. • The weapons they had were replicas, he says. • Egypt said the hijackers wanted to land in Alexandria. The flight, an Airbus A320, took off Friday morning from Sabha, a desert city in southwestern Libya. Hijackers forced the plane to divert to Malta, some 350 kilometers (217 miles) from the Libyan coast in the Mediterranean Sea. After the aircraft landed late Friday morning, the Maltese military led negotiations with hijackers, who threatened to blow up the aircraft with hand grenades, Foreign Ministry spokesman Etienne St. John said.  By early Friday afternoon a group of women was allowed to leave the plane. Later, the remaining passengers and crew left, smiling and chatting as they stepped off the plane and onto the tarmac.  Maltese Prime Minister Joseph Muscat posted details of negotiations in real time on his Twitter account. The hijackers are probably of Libyan nationality, Muscat told reporters after the standoff ended. The men are in custody and being interrogated, he said. Forensic tests revealed the weapons they had were replicas, Muscat said. Egypt: We stopped plane from landing here, Before it landed in Malta, the hijacked plane had requested to land at Burj   airport in Alexandria, Egypt, the Egyptian Civil Aviation Ministry said in a statement. The Egyptian government didn’t allow the flight to enter its airspace, the ministry said. Flights delayed, As the situation unfolded, several flights to and from Malta International Airport were delayed, and some were diverted to Italy. Carmen Nistor, who was waiting for a flight to Munich, Germany, said passengers were frustrated because they hadn’t been informed about the cause of the delays. Gadhafi loyalists, Sabha, the city where the flight began its journey, has been a center of political tribal violence. Deadly clashes have erupted there between tribes that were loyal to Gadhafi and   groups. Enmity runs deep between the Gaddadfa and Suleiman tribes, the most powerful armed factions in the region. Gadhafi, who was a member of the Gaddadfa tribe and led Libya for more than 40 years, was ousted and assassinated by rebels in 2011 in the Arab Spring uprising. Libya has struggled to install a stable government since, and the leadership vacuum has allowed militant groups such as ISIS and al Qaeda to flourish."
258,"Amazon’s plan for 100,000 new jobs in the US may not exactly be what Trump was looking for",2017-01-13,"’’ ’Amazon is  in the US over the next 18 months.’ ”The announcement, which comes a month after Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos’  certainly plays nice with Trump’s   rhetoric and should help Amazon ease its tension with the   who frequently criticized the company during his campaign.” ”But the new jobs may not exactly be focused on the traditional   jobs in areas like manufacturing or infrastructure, from which Trump drew his biggest support. Instead, most of them are likely to be highly skilled tech positions, based on Amazon’s total number of job listings, analyzed by Baird Equity Research’s Colin Sebastian.” ’As seen in the chart below, more than half of the current job listings are in ”technology,” for positions such as computer engineers or data scientists. Only a tiny fraction (about 5%) of those jobs are in fulfillment centers, where products are stored and packaged for delivery, and require fewer skills.’ ’’ ’To be clear, Amazon did say ”many” of the 100, 000 new jobs will be in its fulfillment centers, although it did not break down corporate versus fulfillment jobs. Also, Amazon has been significantly expanding its fulfillment network  —   it built 26 new facilities in 2016, up from 14 in 2015.’ ’In a statement, Bezos stressed that a lot of the jobs would be in ”local communities,” not just Amazon’’s home turf of Seattle or Silicon Valley.’ ’”These jobs are not just in our Seattle headquarters or in Silicon Valley  —   they’’re in our customer service network, fulfillment centers, and other facilities in local communities throughout the country,” Bezos said.’ ”Still, it’s hard to imagine Amazon drastically shifting its job openings to fulfillment positions in such a short time, especially when a big chunk of its new investments are expected to be in building streaming content, growing overseas markets (India) and strengthening its   ecosystem, as seen in this chart by Evercore’s Ken Sena.” ’’"
259,Struggles in a Steel Town Highlighted by Donald Trump - The New York Times,2016-07-06,"MONESSEN, Pa.  —   Thirty years have passed, almost to the day, since the last blasts of the steel furnaces that were the reason for this city’s existence. The steel mill is gone  —   used to film “RoboCop,” then demolished. Most of the people are gone, too, and those who remain are struggling to find a new purpose for this place. Last week, Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, came here to declare that as president, he would revive the fortunes of the American steel industry  —   and, by implication, Monessen. “We are going to put   steel back into the backbone of our country,” Mr. Trump told 200 invited guests at an aluminum recycling facility that occupies part of the old mill complex. “This alone will create massive numbers of jobs. ” In fact, about 71 percent of the steel used last year in the United States was made in the United States, according to the American Iron and Steel Institute. The mills in Monessen and other cities along the Monongahela River were not replaced by Chinese factories but by smaller, more efficient factories in other parts of the country. Having lived through that transition, the people here surrendered hope of a   revival long ago. They are focused on smaller dreams, like scraping together a few million dollars to knock down hundreds of abandoned buildings, which might clear the way for the city to start over. “Our government spent $10 to $12 million looking for that Malaysian airliner,” said Louis Mavrakis, the city’s Democratic mayor, who said that he had written two unanswered letters to President Obama before extending an invitation to Mr. Trump. “Act like I’m a foreign country. Give me $5 million and I can get rid of this blight. ” Monessen’s bolder visions are of something postindustrial and modern, like in Pittsburgh, 35 miles north. “We’re dying rather than letting something new grow and move forward,” said Charles Mrlack, 42, who owns a plumbing and contracting business. The problem, he said, is that older residents know that steel is not coming back, but they cannot imagine anything else. “Everybody is just defeated,” he said. Monessen was created by steel magnates who built factories in a stretch of flatlands along the Monongahela. By 1930, more than 20, 000 people lived in the long, narrow downtown, or on the steep slopes behind. Workers here rolled steel for Chrysler cars and cables for the Golden Gate Bridge. The city’s golden age lasted into the 1960s. Older residents  —   and they are mostly older  —   still remember a downtown so crowded that people had to walk in the streets. The Pittsburgh region’s steelmaking capacity fell to 7. 1 million tons in 2008, from 25. 4 million tons in 1978, according to Frank Giarratani, an economist at the University of Pittsburgh who studies the industry. During that same period, the number of area steelworkers fell to 15, 500 from 85, 000. What are the chances that steel will again be made in Monessen? “There is no possibility of that under any circumstances,” Mr. Giarratani said. Monessen’s largest factory, the massive Wheeling  Pittsburgh steel mill, closed in 1986. The city’s population continues to fall, dropping below 7, 500 last year. The sewer system is collapsing, and erosion is undermining streets and sidewalks. It is getting harder for the high school football team to fill its roster. For years, residents dreamed that a new company would take over the old factory. But in the   a county redevelopment authority decided to demolish the core of the old mill complex and to make the other buildings available to smaller companies. All four of Matt Shorraw’s grandparents worked at the Monessen steel mill, but his parents did not. They had seen the writing on the wall. For Mr. Shorraw, 25, the giant mill that once dominated the city is barely a memory. “I remember when they tore the blast furnaces down,” he said. “It was a big deal. My dad took me. I was 5. ” A few hundred people now work for other businesses on the site, including at the aluminum recycling facility where Mr. Trump spoke last week. One former tenant, a glassmaking company, was feted as a   success story by the Obama administration in 2011. It closed the next year, a victim of the collapse in the   industry. Josh Turkovich, 33, said he would have liked a steady job at the local mill. “You could see the guys who worked there had a good life,” he said, “the car, the house. ” Instead, after graduating from a nearby college, Mr. Turkovich took a   job at a Pittsburgh hospital, an hour’s drive each way. Mr. Turkovich is now trying to build a business in Monessen. He repairs cellphones and is renovating a downtown building he bought in April. He became a father in January, and said he would like to remain closer to home. “I never thought about leaving,” he said. But staying is not so easy. Last week, the roof on the building across the street collapsed. He worries that building could fall into his store. The city’s younger residents are frustrated that the older generation still dreams of factories. They want to replace some of the old mills with waterfront homes and restaurants. They would like to see the city and the river meet, instead of being almost entirely separated by the old industrial strip. A few years ago, the city was approached by a developer who wanted to create an indoor sports park in one of the old warehouses. The idea was rejected as unindustrial. The city does not lack for other ideas. Some residents think it should try to attract artists. Mr. Shorraw, who has a   job as an assistant band director at the town’s high school, wants to create a music center in a downtown building that once housed a grocery store. A local businesswoman recently pitched to the City Council the idea of using part of the old factory site as a medical marijuana farm. Mr. Mavrakis, the mayor, has little patience for these dreams. A blunt and forceful man who spent much of his life as a union organizer, he would like to demolish much of the remaining downtown and offer the land for new development. “I understand that we can’t get all the way back,” he said. “I’d like to get halfway. ” Possibly the town’s greatest success story has come from a company almost as old as Monessen itself, and without any public planning or help. The Douglas Education Center was founded in 1904 as a finishing school for high school graduates headed into corporate jobs. The school has become a primary training ground for people who create   monsters for movies, thanks to a program created by Tom Savini, a Pittsburgh native, an actor and a renowned makeup artist for horror movies. The school now has offices in an old church, classrooms in a former hospital and workshops in a former convent now stuffed with models and masks of monsters, ghouls and aliens. A soundstage with a green screen occupies what was once a furniture showroom. The education center employs more than 70 people, and there are 200 to 300 students enrolled in a variety of training programs. “I tell people, ‘If you want to look at pretty trees and a beautiful city, go to Miami,’” said Tony Baez Milan, the school’s director of admissions. “‘You want to get a job? Come to Monessen. ’” For students who like monsters, he adds, the crumbling city has its own charm. Kayla Eversole, 19, came all the way from Japan, where she grew up. She found the school online and was surprised by the city. Five months later, she said she was glad to be here. No, she said, she had no idea there was once a giant steel mill down the street."
260,Arnold Schwarzenegger On Trump: I Wanted To ’Smash His Face’,2017-02-05,"Arnold Schwarzenegger has opened up about his very public feud with President Donald Trump in a new interview with Men’s Journal. [Trump and Schwarzenegger’s seemingly innocent beef began on social media with the president poking fun at the season premiere ratings drop of New Celebrity Apprentice, a show Schwarzenegger took the helm of after Trump won the White House.

I think I have to be above all of that and put him on the spot. ’” That’s when the feud spilled over into public barbs being hurled   . Schwarzenegger sat in front of a camera and challenged Trump to “work for ALL of the American people as aggressively as you worked for your ratings. ” Please study this quote from Lincoln’s inaugural, @realDonaldTrump.

Schwarzenegger has since slammed Trump’s nominee for Director of the Environmental Protection Agency, Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt. The action star has also railed against Trump’s executive order temporarily suspending the U. S. Refugee Admissions Program, saying it makes America “look stupid. ” Earlier this week, Trump called Schwarzenegger a “total disaster” during the National Prayer Breakfast and prayed for a rise in ratings for the Apprentice. Schwarzenegger fired back, suggesting that he and Trump switch jobs “so people can finally sleep comfortably again. ” In an attempt to have the last word, Trump tweeted Friday morning that Schwarzenegger “did a really bad job as governor of California” and is “even worse” as the host of The Celebrity Apprentice.

261,Where to Be Single in New York - The New York Times,2017-03-31,"There may be no such thing as an ideal neighborhood for single people, but even in this age of dating apps and websites, neighborhood continues to play a huge role in how, and whom, people choose to date. Whether one is striking up a conversation at a coffee shop or tallying up proximity points with a potential love interest, geography matters in large ways and small. Not fretting about an hourlong postdate commute allows drinks to turn into dinner, for instance. A bar filled with friends may bestow the confidence to initiate a conversation with a stranger, which in turn may lead to the confidence to approach some other stranger, at some other bar, on some other night. In a city as diverse as New York, a neighborhood where dating happens naturally can be difficult to find. And statistics may, like a pickup line, mislead. Dorothy Castillo found the prospect of moving to Manhattan enticing for any number of reasons. Not least of all because she assumed the city’s dating scene would be far superior to that of suburban Rockland County, N. Y. where she’d spent most of her life. “I thought, ‘This is going to be my golden ticket! I’m going to date all the time!’ ” recalled Ms. Castillo, 27, a   teacher who bought a studio apartment in Washington Heights two and a half years ago. “I was truly and honestly  —   I don’t know if this is naïve  —   but I was hoping to meet someone at the grocery store or walking down the street,” she said. Instead, meeting people in person was “near impossible,” she added. “And I consider myself a social person. ” Though not opposed to online dating, she felt out of place in   Washington Heights and found her forays to Midtown and Lower East Side bars disappointing, the men standoffish. Then one day, a friend texted her to come to happy hour at Rambling House, an Irish pub in the Woodlawn neighborhood of the Bronx. “The vibe was great  —   everyone was ready to have a good time and tell you their story,” she recalled. “I texted my mom and said, ‘I want to move to Woodlawn.’ Within a few weeks I was in a Realtor’s office. ” Last May, she did indeed move there, to a     she bought. And Woodlawn, a neighborhood filled with   and   houses as well as some brick apartment buildings, has proved unexpectedly welcoming to Ms. Castillo. “I love it here,” Ms. Castillo said. “There are a lot of young people here because it’s a fun place to live. I’d like to meet someone not in a bar, but I’m just enjoying my 20s, going on some crazy dates. ” In a similarly surprising corollary, a neighborhood with a high percentage of single people doesn’t necessarily translate into a good singles neighborhood. Between 2010 and 2014, Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, had a 36 percent increase in the number of single men (single being defined as a person aged 20 to 34 who has never been married) to 15, 121 from 11, 127, and a 31 percent increase in single women, to 12, 272 from 9, 361  —   one of the largest increases in the city, according to the census bureau’s American Community Survey. Based on that data, the New York City Economic Development Corporation declared the neighborhood “an attractive spot for all young singles” in 2014. Not everyone agrees. The area “is not such a good spot for single people,” said Mirsad Kadribasic, 41, an owner of La Bohème Lounge on Stillwell Avenue in Bensonhurst, which on a recent Friday night was   with couples smoking hookahs at velvet banquettes. “I’m a single person myself and I can’t meet anyone here. “It’s a   neighborhood. People go to work, go home, go to sleep. When people want to go out, they go elsewhere. It’s not like Park Slope, where people are hanging out all the time. ” Though it may be the envy of Bensonhurst, the Park Slope dating scene did not impress Robert DiBiase when he moved there from Washington, D. C. several years ago. The neighborhood had plenty of bars, conceded Mr. DiBiase, 42, an associate broker at Halstead Property, “but they were small and filled with locals, not people coming from Manhattan to hang out. ” The local bars were places where neighbors went to grab a beer and catch up, he said, not places to meet a potential mate. When his aging bulldog compelled him to trade his   for an elevator building, he seized on the opportunity and rented a   on the Lower East Side, a quick walk to local favorites like Stanton Social or Mr. Purple, the rooftop bar at the Hotel Indigo. Now he won’t date anyone who lives in Brooklyn. Or Queens. Or the Upper East Side, for that matter. He prefers to stay within blocks of home. “That’s what apps are for,” he said. “I’m so used to convenience living in New York. I don’t want an     obstacle just to grab a coffee. I don’t want to end up coming back at midnight on some train that stalls in the station because of an investigation. ” Nancy Slotnick, a dating coach, said that proximity was crucial for many single New Yorkers. “The first date is going to happen so much more easily if you’re in the same neighborhood,” she said. And for those hoping to meet in what her clients often refer to as “the natural way,” neighborhood can make all the difference, she said. Certainly, it did for her. One evening, she saw an attractive man at an event on the Upper West Side, where she lived, but she was too shy to approach. Afterward, she was standing on the sidewalk and he walked by again. Loath to let another opportunity pass, she caught his eye, smiled and struck up a conversation. She later found out that he had come into the cafe where she was an owner just the day before. He is now her husband. “Fate gave us another chance!” she said. “I know this sounds hokey, but you get a chance to cross paths with people and you often miss it,” she said. “When you’re in the same neighborhood you get that chance over and over again. ” But Michael J. Rosenfeld, a Stanford University sociology professor who researches how couples meet, said that meeting in the neighborhood, along with meeting through family, friends,   school and church, had declined since the 1990s, largely because of the rise of online dating. “Neighborhood still matters in lots of ways, at least for people who have a choice of where they live, which is not everybody,” he said. “But the ability to find single people to date in the neighborhood matters less than it used to. ” Natasha Zamor, 28, a paralegal who lives in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, said that her neighborhood played almost no role in her dating life. While she enjoys going out with friends to bars by the Barclays Center  —   333 Lounge on Flatbush Avenue is a favorite  —   there’s nothing to tell you if the person you meet at a bar is someone “you want to invest your time in. ” Ms. Zamor’s mother, a nurse, and father, a psychiatrist, emphasized the importance of marrying a man whose education and aspirations were similar to her own. She likes that on dating apps like SoulSwipe, Tinder and Plenty of Fish you can easily find out where someone went to school, what he does for work, and where he lives  —   which she views as important indicators of compatibility. She says she dates “throughout the metro area. ” “I want someone I can communicate with and bring into my circle of friends. Someone who can be equal or better,” Ms. Zamor said, adding that, “unfortunately, this seems to create a standard that can never ever be met. ” Tara Atwood, 33, lived in Manhattan for 10 years after college, first on the Upper East Side, then in Midtown East. She worked in finance and dated “meatheads who wore baggy jeans ripped at the bottom and didn’t want to do anything but drink beer and watch football. ” After ending a   relationship with one such meathead, she left her job to go to business school and moved to 1 North Fourth, a luxury rental on the waterfront in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, which suits her perfectly. “It’s full of people who are  : creative,   educated, curious,” she said. “I would say 75 percent of the people are people you’d swipe right on. Living here has literally been like a live dating app. ” She and friends from the building have traveled to Tulum, Mexico, participated in a coed fantasy football league, gone on daylong bike trips and sweated through SoulCycle classes together. In Manhattan, she said, the men she met through apps would boast about being a top person at a place like Oracle, the   company. “Now I’m into the kind of guy with facial hair who wears a leather bracelet and goes salsa dancing,” she said. While finding one’s tribe may be the underpinning of dating success, certain factors make it more likely to happen in some places than others. Neighborhoods popular with singles tend to have comparatively affordable housing, convenience to transportation and a good assortment of bars and restaurants  —   think Astoria in Queens and Murray Hill and the East Village in Manhattan. Charles Conroy, a salesman for Citi Habitats, said that for his   clients who want to walk out the door into night life, he usually recommends the East Village. He recently found an apartment on Second Avenue and 10th Street for three men in their early 20s, one of whom broke up with his girlfriend so he could move in with his friends and “extend the college experience before moving in with girlfriends down the road. ” “His dating life has skyrocketed,” Mr. Conroy said. “He sends me texts all the time. ” Elie Seidman, the chief executive of OkCupid, an online dating site, said that while he believes that moving to New York might improve a person’s romantic odds, he didn’t believe there was “a magic neighborhood cure. ” Census data shows that neighborhoods with high concentrations of single women don’t often match up with those that have a lot of single men. The New York neighborhoods with the highest ratio of single women to single men, ages 20 to 34, are the Upper East Side (0. 6 men to every woman) Murray Hill (0. 68) the Upper West Side (0. 79) and Brownsville, Brooklyn (0. 8) according to 2014 data from the American Community Survey compiled by the city’s Economic Development Corporation. Neighborhoods with the highest percentages of single men tend to be immigrant communities, according to a researcher at the development corporation  —     Corona, Queens has the best odds for women in the city, with 1. 57 men to every woman Jackson   Corona is a close second at 1. 54 men to every woman. Not all of those men are looking for women  —   Jackson Heights has grown increasingly popular with gay men. The Upper West Side, some say, is the place to be if you’re a single Modern Orthodox Jew. “Really the only other place in the world as good for dating is Jerusalem,” said Curtis Goldstein, a salesman at Halstead. Newcomers quickly find themselves overwhelmed with invitations for Friday night Shabbat dinners, and synagogues vie to be the center of the scene, luring singles with snacks like kosher sushi and meatballs. “I’m a social butterfly, so I love it,” said Jessica Schechter, 29, an actress, director, producer and teacher who moved to the neighborhood in 2011. When she’s not dating someone, she said, she attends at least one neighborhood singles event a week. The dating scene is so frenetic, some people weary of it, including those who fail to meet someone despite what would appear to be every conceivable opportunity. “It can be hard, it can be draining. My roommate jokes about JOMO  —   the joy of missing out,” Ms. Schechter said. But the ceaseless courtship ritual has provided fodder for “Soon by You,” a web series she produces and acts in about dating in the community. For those who tire of the West Side, she added, there’s the smaller dating scene on the East Side. For some singles, less may be more. Dr. Carlos J. Huerta, 40, a dentist, moved to Hell’s Kitchen recently after nine years in the East Village. He left an apartment share to be closer to his   his friends and the practice he had just started. When he and his boyfriend broke up a short time later, he found himself single in the center of one of the city’s most vibrant gay dating scenes. “I loved the East Village. It felt serendipitous, like you could meet people from different walks of life,” Dr. Huerta said. “Hell’s Kitchen is so concentrated with eligible men,” he said. “How do you pick and choose?” He said he was glad that his rental building, Gotham West, is on 11th Avenue, because it affords some distance from the scene. Even so, he’s thinking about moving back downtown. “It’d just be nice to have to think about it a little less, to live in less of a concentrated dating pool,” he said. “To meet someone in more of a chance encounter. ”"
262,Sore Loser: Rep. Jared Huffman (D-CA) to Boycott Inauguration,2017-01-10,"Rep. Jared Huffman ( ) has announced that he will boycott   Donald Trump’s inauguration next Friday, becoming the third U. S. representative to do so. [In a Facebook post on Saturday, Huffman announced that he wanted to protest the start of a “dark and dangerous chapter” for America:  Ordinarily, on Inauguration Day I would take my place above the west steps of the Capitol and join colleagues and dignitaries in honoring a great and solemn American tradition: the peaceful transfer of power which must always transcend partisan differences. Ordinarily, I would do that without hesitation for any President, regardless of their politics or personality, as a show of respect for the institution and the will of the voters  —   and as a gesture of goodwill to foster reconciliation and collaboration as we put the election behind us and prepare to work with the new administration. However, there is nothing ordinary about this inauguration or the man that will be   as our next President. I do accept the election results and support the peaceful transfer of power, but it is abundantly clear to me that with Donald Trump as our President, the United States is entering a dark and very dangerous political chapter. I will do everything I can to limit the damage and the duration of this chapter, and I believe we can get through it. But I will not sit passively and politely applaud as it begins. Instead of attending the inauguration, Huffman said that he would spend the day in his district “doing positive things. ” Huffman represents the second congressional district of California, a coastal district that includes liberal Humboldt County,  the state’s most celebrated marijuana cultivation region. As Breitbart News reported last year, Huffman, a Democratic Party “” defied the views of many of his constituents by supporting former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton over Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ). Huffman joins Reps. Luis Gutierrez ( ) and Katherine Clark ( ) in boycotting what has traditionally been a bipartisan event, where the country comes together for at least one moment to honor the democratic transition of power. The California Democrat said that he had received support from the district, and that “people are really resonating” with his decision to boycott, although he complained about opposition from “these Republicans from Alabama, Indiana and Oklahoma. ” Joel B.

263,Donald Trump rips ’sleaze’ Anthony Weiner and ’problem’ Huma Abedin as he digs in on Clinton emails,2016-10-30,"’  ’ ’   Donald Trump roiled disgraced former Rep. Anthony Weiner and cast   his estranged wife Huma Abedin, a top aide to Hillary Clinton, as   ”a problem” during a lengthy Saturday rant at a Golden, Colorado,   rally where he dug in on the latest bombshell FBI revelation. ’ ’   Trump ripped Weiner as ”a major, major, major sleaze,” and   bragged about calling ”him correctly” in past social media posts. ’ ’   ”Perhaps, through this other investigation, and that’’s the   investigation of a person that over the years I’’ve known a little   bit and watched,” the Republican nominee said. ”Did I call him   correctly? Did anybody see? It’’s called good judgment. It’’s   called good instincts.” ’ ”   FBI Director James Comey  that the agency had   discovered new emails related to its probe into Clinton’s use of   a private server. Reports later indicated the   additional emails uncovered were in connection with an   investigation into Weiner over allegations he sexted with a      girl. ” ’   ”If you check out the tweets, or if you check out whatever it is   I wrote about him, it was so perfect,” Trump said. ”And that was   done a long time ago. But they found, by looking at Anthony   Weiner, a major major major sleaze, they found what may be some   of the 33, 000 missing and deleted emails.” ’ ’’ ’   Trump said Clinton has ”bad” instincts ”when the emails are on   Anthony Weiner’’s  —   whatever.” ’ ’   The New York businessman also asked whether Clinton would   keep Abedin after the latest revelations. ’ ’   ”Is she going to keep Huma?” Trump asked. ”Huma’’s been a problem.   Do we agree? Huma. Huma’’s been a problem. I wonder if Huma’’s   going to stay there.” ’ ’   ”And I hope they haven’’t given Huma immunity,” he continued.   ”Because it seemed like every person who walked down the sidewalk   got immunity.

It turned out, it does. And this is very   serious stuff.” ’ ’ Trump  Weiner. In 2013, when Weiner   was seeking the mayor’’s office in New York City, Trump posted a   Vine demanding that ”no perverts” should be elected to the   office. He later called for Abedin to ”dump the sicko Weiner,”   predicted Weiner would be ”back sexting with a vengeance”   after the 2013 mayoral race, and mocked Weiner’’s revealed   sexting identity ”Carlos Danger.” ’ ’   In August, Trump alleged that Weiner was ”a major security   risk as a collector of info” due to his marriage to Abedin, after   a bombshell story broke that Weiner had allegedly been sexting   with an underage girl, sparking the current investigation. ’ ’   Trump himself is under scrutiny for allegations of past sexual   misconduct that arose after a leaked tape showed him boasting of   being able to make unwanted sexual advances on women, to which a   fleet of women came forward in the following weeks alleging that   Trump did exactly that to them. Trump has vehemently denied those   claims. ’ ”   The FBI’s announcement on Friday threw a wrench into an   already turbulent presidential campaign with just 11 days before   Election Day, coming as Clinton held leads Trump, in national   polls and surveys in key battleground states. ”"
264,Scalise’s condition upgraded to ’serious’,2017-06-17," (CNN) Louisiana Rep. Steve Scalise’s condition has been upgraded to ”serious” after he underwent surgery Saturday for injuries sustained in a shooting at a Republican congressional baseball practice earlier this week, the hospital treating him said in a release. Scalise, the   GOP leader in the House, ”continues to show signs of improvement,” MedStar Washington Hospital Center said in a statement released on behalf of his family. ”He is more responsive, and is speaking with his loved ones. The Scalise family greatly appreciates the outpouring of thoughts and prayers.” Scalise, Tyson Foods lobbyist Matt Mika, congressional aide Zach Barth and US Capitol Police officer Crystal Griner were shot during an attack on the Republican congressional baseball team as it practiced Wednesday morning. Capitol Police officer David Bailey and Texas Rep. Roger Williams were also injured during the incident. The gunman, identified by law enforcement officials as    James Hodgkinson of Belleville, Illinois, later died from injuries sustained during a shootout with police on the scene. Although Scalise was able to talk while lying injured on the ball field, he had gone into shock by the time he was transported by helicopter to the hospital and arrived ”in critical condition with an imminent risk of death,” Sava said. He added that Scalise would be in the hospital ”for some time” and would need ”a period of healing and rehabilitation” after being discharged. Mika also remained hospitalized Saturday after undergoing an additional surgery. His family said in a statement he was showing ”positive results” and was expected to make a full recovery. Griner remained in the hospital in good condition after sustaining a gunshot wound to the ankle, according to a Friday update. Bailey, Barth, and Williams have been treated and released."
265,Socialism Has Destroyed Venezuela – So Why Does the Opposition Trust the Socialist International? - Breitbart,2017-04-12,"Socialism has destroyed Venezuela. State corporate takeovers, strict price controls, and a food rationing system have left the country poor, sick, and literally starving. Socialist political repression has killed countless Venezuelans in the past decade and put an untold number of others in the nation’s notoriously violent prisons. [The United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV) the vehicle late dictator Hugo Chávez used to consolidate power and posthumously hand it over to Nicolás Maduro, has forced the OPEC nation with the world’s largest oil reserves to import oil from  —   of all places  —   capitalist bogeyman America.  The party, however, remains in power, challenged by a fractured opposition whose members have deep ties to the Socialist International. If socialism destroyed Venezuela, socialism cannot save it, and the leaders of the opposition appear to be learning this the hard way. The seemingly ceaseless protests  —   intensifying in 2014 but growing ever violent today  —   and the populous Venezuelan diaspora largely resettling in Florida prove socialism not merely a failed ideology, but a vastly unpopular one. Declining support from allies like China and Russia (and, even worse, continued support from Syria and North Korea) prove little hope remains in the   stability of the Maduro regime internationally, either. A robust and organized opposition should have a firm chance of reclaiming the future of Venezuela for Venezuelans. And yet the Venezuelan opposition has largely failed. Its biggest victory was the reclaiming of the National Assembly, the federal legislative body, by majority in December 2015. Then, a coalition of political parties known as the Democratic Unity Roundtable (MUD) promised to use its lawmaking power to free the nation’s political prisoners, rehabilitate the nation’s economy, and topple the     socialist dictatorship. The MUD has failed in all its objectives. The nation’s most prominent political prisoner, Leopoldo López of the Popular Will party, remains behind bars, serving a   sentence for organizing peaceful protests against the government. The economy is worse than ever, heading for a record 1, 600 percent inflation this year, according to International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates. The dictatorship, meanwhile, appears rejuvenated, having barred the National Assembly from passing laws and stripped Henrique Capriles Radonski, the governor of Miranda state and opposition presidential candidate, of his title and right to run for public office this week. In addition to promising to expand individual freedom in Venezuela, the MUD vowed to use internationally mediated dialogue to get the Maduro government to agree to its demands. Under the watchful eye of the Vatican, MUD representatives wasted much of 2016 attempting to get Maduro representatives to speak with them, never mind discuss their concerns. By December 2016, the talks had collapsed entirely, with Capriles personally accusing Maduro of “making a mockery of the Pope. ” Many opposition supporters wondered why the MUD held so strongly to the idea of friendly talks with a regime that had imprisoned,   killed, and wounded so many in the opposition  —   why it had not taken aggressively to toppling socialism in Venezuela. As the talks collapsed, one international entity appeared consistently supportive of the opposition efforts for dialogue, however, condemning the socialist government and baffling casual observers: the Socialist International. Three of the five articles currently on the Socialist International’s homepage are condemnations of the socialist government of Venezuela. A photo of Leopoldo López behind bars adorns the page. The most recent article condemns the attempt by the nation’s Supreme Court to usurp the National Assembly’s power, calling for “an end to the denial, obstacles and impediments so that the National Assembly of Venezuela, elected by all Venezuelan citizens, can immediately resume its legislative work, with full recognition of its members’ parliamentary immunity. ” “This crisis has inexorably hit the people in Venezuela following poor, authoritarian and centralise [sic] leadership that is indifferent to the suffering caused by its actions,” the article concludes. Note the adjectives used to describe Venezuela’s government: “poor,” “authoritarian,” “centralised. ” Notably absent is the adjective with which the regime identifies most: “socialist. ” The Socialist International has invested so heavily in supporting Venezuela’s opposition for the simple reason that a number of MUD coalition parties are also members of the SI, and among the Vice Presidents of the organization is Henry Ramos Allup, the head of the Democratic Action Party (AD) both an SI and MUD member. Four SI members parties operate in Venezuela: (AD) Popular Will, Movement for Socialism (MAS) and A New Era (UNT). Three of the four are members of the MUD. The fourth, Popular Will, advocates in their manifesto for the   human rights popularized at the United Nations by the Soviet Union: “the right to a comfortable home  …     the right to fresh food, potable water, health care, and medicine  …     the right to education. ” The result of this relationship between the SI and the allegedly   Venezuelan opposition has been a stunted attempt at restoring fundamental rights and freedoms. With its undue respect to the constitution of Venezuela  —   implemented by Hugo Chávez in 1999  —   and failed dialogue with Maduro, the MUD has been the target of increasing frustration on the part of opposition leaders unaffiliated to the SI, like the aforementioned Capriles and legislator María Corina Machado. This socialist infiltration has not only paralyzed the opposition but threatens to deform the future of a Venezuela without Maduro into something that looks quite a bit like the country’s present and recent past. Without abandoning socialism, Venezuela will never save itself from socialism, and the sooner opposition leaders realize that the more damage to the nation they can prevent."
266,Trump Allies Dismayed by Huge Number of White House Leaks - Breitbart,2017-02-09,"The Hill remarks on the high volume of leaks from the Trump White House, to the dismay of President Trump’s allies and the delight of adversarial journalists:[Barely a day goes by without some unusual tale emerging from 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. Recent examples in a single New York Times story included the assertion that White House aides have held meetings in the dark because they can’t figure out how the lights work and that the president is fond of watching television alone in his bathrobe. Trump took to Twitter to assert that the Times “writes total fiction” about him, while White House press secretary Sean Spicer insisted that the president does not even own a bathrobe. More serious matters have been leaked as well, such as descriptions of Trump’s call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. Trump apparently said a U. S.  deal on refugees, agreed to by President Obama, was “the worst deal ever,” and told Turnbull their conversation was “the worst call by far” among several he had held with world leaders that day. “There have been a ton of leaks. It seems that everyone has their own leaking apparatus,” said one of the dismayed Trump allies. “I don’t know how it affects morale, but it is certainly a distraction. They have 55 firehoses aimed at them. Enough of the palace intrigue!”  The Hill reports on speculation the leaks are part of a struggle for supremacy between White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and strategist Steve Bannon (formerly of Breitbart News). “Insiders” shot this theory down as an “oversimplification,” arguing that Priebus and Bannon get along much better than the press tends to portray them. Another theory is that knives are coming out for White House press secretary Sean Spicer, whose friends are presumably pushing back to protect him. The Huffington Post proposes that the leaks are coming from veteran officials who are “alarmed by the president’s conduct,” because while some of the leaks are “based on opposition to his policies,” many others “appear motivated by a belief that Trump’s words, deeds, and Tweets pose a genuine threat. ” Actively sabotaging an administration one is supposedly concerned about would be a remarkably selfish and even dangerous strategy, which makes it entirely plausible for Washington lifers. The Huffington Post implies that “widespread leaks and warnings from the national security establishment” over Steve Bannon’s membership in the National Security Council might have played a role in the Yemen raid that went wrong on January 29th. The American people should feel no sense of appreciation or gratitude for those who put American troops in jeopardy and harm our national interests because they want leverage over the president. CNBC cites the advent of an encrypted messaging platform called SecureDrop during the 2016 election cycle, plus the increasing use of various other secure communication systems, as one reason for the high volume of leaks. “It’s hard to name a news organization that has not gotten in touch with us about installing SecureDrop in the past six weeks,” Trevor Timm, executive director of the Freedom of the Press Foundation, said of his organization’s popular tool. He said he thought “general fear that Trump could turn the U. S.’ surveillance on the press” combined with “unrest” in the administration was driving interest in SecureDrop. That’s an interesting contrast with how the press managed only a few days of outrage after President Barack Obama really did turn government surveillance systems on them. “I don’t think it’s impossible that a combination of leaks, and whistleblowers and investigative journalism eventually lead to the downfall of Trump,” Timm added. There might be some manufactured drama in all that talk of encrypted communications. As Randy Evans of the Republican National Committee pointed out to the Huffington Post, leakers aren’t usually caught by wiretapping or email monitoring. The preferred method is the “  test,” in which bits of juicy information are given to suspected leakers, and the boss watches to see which tidbits turn up in the press. President Trump himself has blamed the leaks on “Obama people” left over from the previous administration, in particular citing his leaked phone conversations with the leaders of Australia and Mexico. “It’s a disgrace that they leaked because it’s very much against our country.  It’s a very dangerous thing for this country,” Trump told Fox News."
267,"As Kelly and Tillerson Visit Mexico, Their Reassurances Differ From Trump’s Stance - The New York Times",2017-02-24,"MEXICO CITY  —   In the White House, President Trump was telling American chief executives on Thursday that the days of being treated unfairly by Mexico  —   on trade, on immigration, on crime  —   were over. “You see what’s happening at the border: All of a sudden, for the first time, we’re getting gang members out,” Mr. Trump said, referring to his instructions to increase deportations of undocumented immigrants. “And it’s a military operation. ” But in Mexico, his homeland security secretary, John F. Kelly, was saying the opposite, trying to tamp down fears of a military operation and to assure the public that American soldiers would not be used to police the border. “I repeat: There will be no use of military in this,” Mr. Kelly said at a news conference on Thursday, appearing with Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson. “At least half of you try to get that right, because it continues to come up in your reporting. ” Mr. Trump has a penchant for dropping unwelcome surprises during visits between the United States and Mexico. Last month, on the first day of a trip to Washington by Mexico’s foreign minister, Mr. Trump signed an executive order to build a wall between the two countries. Then, this week, just before Mr. Kelly and Mr. Tillerson touched down in Mexico, his administration released policies that vastly expanded the potential for deportation of undocumented immigrants. Mr. Trump is certainly not the only American president to clamp down on illegal immigration. His predecessor, Barack Obama, deported record numbers of immigrants, including gang members. But Mr. Trump’s actions and disparaging remarks about Mexico have helped push relations between the two countries to their lowest point in decades. His steady stream of provocative policies and statements has enraged the Mexican public and left their leaders to consider their own leverage in the event of a meltdown in ties between the two countries, whether on trade, migration or security. On Thursday, the contradictions between the president and his top staff raised a pressing question: Which version of Washington will come to bear on Mexico in the coming months? Will it be the aggressive approach of the president or the more reassuring stance of Mr. Kelly, who will be assigned to oversee some of the proposals likely to antagonize Mexico the most? “Let me be very, very clear,” Mr. Kelly said, assuring Mexicans that the rules for deporting people from the United States had not fundamentally changed  —   another possible contradiction of his boss. “There will be no, repeat no, mass deportations. ” The statements during the visit offered a startling departure from past trips to Mexico by American diplomats. Four officials  —   two from Mexico and two from the United States  —   walked into a large ballroom with grim faces and made carefully worded comments without taking any questions. It was the kind of cautious staging normally seen after tough negotiations between adversaries, not talks between friendly neighbors. No one suggested that a breakthrough had been made. “Two strong sovereign countries from time to time will have differences,” Mr. Tillerson said. Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray of Mexico called it a “complex moment in the relationship. ” In the last month, Mexican officials have shown cautious restraint, and even silence, in response to Mr. Trump’s threats, often to the frustration of the Mexican people. Their logic, officials say, is cleareyed: To descend into a fight with the United States would serve no one, least of all the Mexican people who are spoiling for a harder line against Mr. Trump. But that is not to say the Mexicans are without recourse. While they are hoping to avoid a confrontation, the whispers of discontent have started to spread. The minister of economy has said there will be no trade talks without similar talks on security and migration, twin areas of vulnerability for the United States. And Mr. Videgaray, responding to a directive from Mr. Trump broadening the scope of deportations in America, has vowed to bring to the United Nations any actions by the United States to send   to Mexico. Mexico is keenly aware of its leverage in the bilateral relationship: billions of dollars in agricultural purchases by Mexico, a decade of security cooperation to dismantle cartels and intercept drugs destined for the United States, and the detention of hundreds of thousands of migrants passing through Mexico on their way to America’s southern border. On trade, putting aside the supply chains of vehicles and electronics engineered by the North American Free Trade Agreement, agriculture is a major vulnerability for the United States. Mexico is an immense purchaser of American farm goods. The nation is the No. 1 purchaser of American corn, dairy, pork and rice. Mexico purchased nearly $2 billion of corn in 2016 and also bought large amounts of soybeans, wheat, cotton and beef. A Mexican lawmaker recently proposed a bill to redirect purchases of corn away from the United States, a tactic that could devastate American corn farmers in the heartland of Mr. Trump’s base. Both Brazil and Argentina offer alternatives to the American Corn Belt, experts and officials say. “There are a lot of jobs in agriculture that are dependent on Nafta in America,” said Gregorio Schneider, the founder of TC Latin America Partners, a New   private equity firm that invests in Mexico. “You are talking about the center of the United States. ” On national security, Mexico also plays a large role. The government could slow down extraditions to the United States, keeping   drug lords like Joaquín Guzmán Loera, known as El Chapo, instead of sending them north. It could also stop deporting American fugitives who have fled to Mexico. Perhaps more threatening to the United States would be a reconsideration of Mexico’s participation in the drug war. For more than a decade, the Mexican authorities have cooperated in arresting top cartel leaders and intercepting drug shipments destined for the United States. Mexico could also leverage its participation in the sharing of intelligence. The vast majority of drugs funneled  —   and tunneled  —   through Mexico are not for domestic consumption. “We receive information from Mexican authorities on a daily basis that helps us better target drugs smugglers at the border,” said Gil Kerlikowske, who was the commissioner of Customs and Border Protection in the Obama administration. “These are ties we want to strengthen, not weaken. ” Mr. Kerlikowske said Mexican federal police officers were stationed in Tucson and in Laredo, Tex. where they assist American law enforcement in identifying drug cartels and human smugglers by sharing information in Mexican criminal history databases. Likewise, American Customs and Border Protection officers are assigned to a joint program in Mexico City, where they share information on possible drug traffickers through the use of American law enforcement databases. In 2015, joint operations between the Border Patrol and Mexican law enforcement led to the discovery of 30 drug tunnels and about 80, 000 pounds of drugs. Whether policing the southern American border to prevent unwanted migrants from entering the United States or examining passenger manifests to ensure   suspects cannot enter through Mexico, the authorities here have been a critical component of America’s national security strategy. In 2014, Mexico launched Plan Frontera Sur to safeguard its southern border from migrants trying to enter from Central America. The plan has essentially served as a dragnet 1, 000 miles south of the Texas border, catching hundreds of thousands of Salvadorans, Hondurans and Guatemalans en route to the United States. Some experts and officials have suggested that Mexico could simply ease up on its border patrols, granting passage to large numbers of Central Americans. That would not only swamp the American authorities, but might enable potentially dangerous migrants to slip into the country. Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, tried later in the day to clarify the contradiction between Mr. Trump’s and Mr. Kelly’s remarks. He said that Mr. Trump had not meant to characterize the deportation efforts as a military operation, arguing that the president had been using the word “military” as an adjective. “It’s being done with precision,” Mr. Spicer said. The meetings here on Thursday produced a modicum of agreement between the United States and Mexico. Both Mr. Tillerson and Mr. Kelly acknowledged the significance of border cooperation to address the flow of migration from Central America to the United States. It is a topic that Mr. Kelly, who led more than 1, 000 military personnel of the United States Southern Command, knows something about. He has in the past outlined a more balanced approach to protecting the borders, saying security cannot “be attempted as an endless series of ‘  stands’ on the   line at the official ports of entry or along the thousands of miles of border between this country and Mexico. ” This could place him once more at odds with the mandates of his boss, Mr. Trump, whose executive order to build a wall will fall directly among Mr. Kelly’s responsibilities."
268,"Maoists for Trump? In China, Fans Admire His Nationalist Views - The New York Times",2017-04-05,"BEIJING  —   They protest, picket and sing to defend Mao’s memory, yearning for the East to be red again. But lately some of China’s Maoists are finding inspiration in an unlikely insurgent in the West: Donald J. Trump. Mr. Trump “has torn up the old rules of the ruling elites, not just of the capitalist West,” said Zhang Hongliang, a polemicist who is the loudest proponent of what could be loosely called “Maoists for Trump. ” In a recent essay, Mr. Zhang lauded the American president as being alone among national leaders daring “to openly promote the political ideas of Chairman Mao. ” President Xi Jinping of China will be sizing up Mr. Trump during a visit to his    estate in Florida this week, in the leaders’ first summit meeting. Meanwhile, many ordinary Chinese people have also been taking the measure of the new American president and have been bewildered, incensed and yet, sometimes, inspired. The global wave of nationalist,   sentiment that Mr. Trump rode to power has washed ashore in China, encouraging a   fringe that is hostile to capitalism and Western influence, and that the Communist Party has long sought to cultivate  —   and contain. China’s Maoists are a small minority most Chinese have no desire to revive the ruthless, convulsive politics of the Mao era. But the Maoists’ growing assertiveness, echoed in their embrace of aspects of Mr. Trump’s agenda, could help push the country in a more authoritarian direction. They also complicate the efforts of  Mr. Xi to play both sides of an ideological divide: as a robust defender of Mao’s legacy, but also a proponent of market liberalization and even a champion of globalization in the Trump age. It is a paradox that these admirers of Mao Zedong, a Marxist revolutionary who railed against Western imperialism, have found things to like about this American president, a property tycoon with a cabinet crowded with millionaires. But they want Mr. Xi to take a page from Mr. Trump’s “America First” script and protect Chinese workers from layoffs, privatization and foreign competition. “Trump opposes globalization, and so should China,” said one article on Utopia, a popular Maoist website. “Trump’s ideology has oriented toward China, and he is learning from China,” said another   Chinese site. China’s   as they are sometimes called, are loosely united by demands for stringent economic equality, zealous nationalism and a loathing of the capitalist West and liberal democracy. “Many of the same ideas now animating the global populist movement have been the hallmarks of the   movement for over a decade,” said Jude Blanchette, a researcher in Beijing who is writing a book about the movement. “The   have also clearly benefited from the rise of Xi Jinping, as he has blasted a pretty large dog whistle in their direction,” Mr. Blanchette added. Many on China’s far left see Mr. Trump as a dangerous foe who has questioned established American policy on Taiwan, vowed to confront China’s hold on the disputed South China Sea and threatened to cut Chinese exports to America. But some Maoists say Mr. Trump also offers a model. They think he led a populist revolt that humbled a corrupt political establishment not unlike what they see in China. They cheer his incendiary tactics, sometimes likening them to Mao’s methods. And they hear in his remarks an echo of their own disgust with Western democracy, American interventionism and liberal political values. Maoist meetings and websites dwell on a clutch of enemies, including the C. I. A. and America in general, genetically modified crops and advocates of privatizing state companies. But they reserve a particular venom for liberal Chinese intellectuals and celebrities who have condemned Mao. In the West, Mr. Zhang argued, the nationalists are on the right while the left generally supports internationalism. “But China is the opposite,” he said. “Chinese rightists are the traitors, while Chinese leftists are the patriots. ” The Communist Party never repudiated Mao’s legacy after his death in 1976, but it condemned his excesses, including the violent Cultural Revolution, and for years he was ignored or discredited while Deng Xiaoping pursued economic liberalization. In the 1990s, though, the party refurbished Mao’s image and fostered a popular revival to bolster its authority and blunt calls for political liberalization. Officials started using Maoists to intimidate liberal academics, dissidents and other critics. Before Mr. Xi came to power in 2012, a political rival, Bo Xilai, openly encouraged “red” nostalgia for the Mao era as part of an effort to build a populist power base. Mr. Bo was purged in a scandal, but the Maoists regrouped as Mr. Xi associated himself more closely with Mao’s legacy than his predecessors and called for a return to Marxist purity. Under Mr. Xi, Maoists have become bolder in taking to the streets and organizing online campaigns. A court ruling last year and legislation adopted last month protecting Communist heroes buoyed them further. Nobody expects Maoists to seize power in Beijing. They are disdained by the middle class and kept on a tether by the party authorities. Across China, there are maybe a few thousand active supporters of Maoist groups and causes, and their petitions against liberal intellectuals have gathered tens of thousands of signatures online, according to Mr. Blanchette, the researcher. But the Chinese left’s broader message of muscular nationalism and its criticism of widening inequality have reverberated, especially among retirees,   workers and former party officials dismayed by extravagant wealth and corruption. Mr. Trump and the global surge of nationalism and populism have added to the political tinder. Dai Jianzhong, a sociologist in Beijing, said Maoists could gain a bigger following if an economic slowdown caused mass layoffs, or if tensions with the United States escalated into confrontation. “It was a big shock for China to see American   society overwhelmed by this tide of populism,” Mr. Dai said. “China is a different society, but if the economy stagnates and workers feel badly let down, populism will gain influence. The influence of Maoists and ultraleftists would spread. ” In January, about a hundred protesters gathered in Jinan, a provincial capital in eastern China, to condemn a professor of communications and advertising, Deng Xiangchao, who had dared criticize Mao online. They chanted and held banners near Mr. Deng’s home, reviling him as a “traitor” and “enemy of the people,” and roughed up a few people who came to show their support for him. “We love Chairman Mao because we’re poor, and the poor all love Chairman Mao,” Yang Jianguo, a retired worker who was among the protesters, said by telephone after the protest. The university swiftly dismissed Mr. Deng rather than engage in a prolonged battle with the Maoists. Later,   activists also successfully demanded the dismissal of a television station worker who had voiced support for Mr. Deng. It would be unthinkable for the party to be so obliging of protesters for free speech or other causes the party considers anathema. But while Mr. Xi has silenced the party’s liberal critics, the party has tolerated, even abetted, its   opponents, giving the Maoist populists room to grow stronger. “Their influence has clearly grown with the leftist turn in ideology, especially since 2015,” said Deng Yuwen, a current affairs writer in Beijing who has criticized the Maoists. “It’s not that the top level of the party directly controls them, but the Maoists are politically astute, and they have a good sense of what they can get away with,” he added. “They know the officials use them, but they also use the officials. ” While party leaders may find them useful for intimidating critics, the Maoists want to take China in a different direction and reverse market policies that have fueled decades of growth, by seizing the assets of the rich and strengthening state ownership of industry, for example. Most phrase their criticism of the party carefully, but some openly accuse it of betraying Mao. “China is a capitalist state under socialist guise,” said Mr. Yang, the retired worker. “Capitalists dominate the country. ” Asked about the American president, Mr. Yang was more generous: “Trump has socialist tendencies, because the way he won power in a way reflected the workers’ demands. ” Many Maoists see Mr. Xi as a fellow traveler who is taking China in the right direction by restoring respect for Mao and Marx. But others say privately that even Mr. Xi may not be a dependable ally. They point out that he has promoted himself abroad as a proponent of expanding global trade and a friend of multinational corporations, drawing an implicit contrast with Mr. Trump. He Weifang, a law professor at Peking University who is often reviled by China’s far left, said Mr. Xi was playing a dangerous game by allowing Maoist populists to silence liberal voices and risked igniting political fires that he cannot easily control. “If political currents in China increasingly converge with populism,” Mr. He added, “that would have a powerful effect on China’s future. ”"
269,Trump derides intel briefing on ’so-called’ Russian hacking,2017-01-04,"Washington (CNN)  Donald Trump took to Twitter Tuesday evening to deride the US intelligence agencies due to brief him on alleged Russian hacking of American political groups. It was his latest attack on a key body he will rely on as commander in chief and again put him at odds with the agencies’ unanimous conclusion that Russia hacked Democratic Party groups and individuals to interfere in the US presidential election. Trump suggested that intelligence officials postponed an ” ’intelligence’ briefing on   ’Russian hacking’ ” that they were set to deliver to him this week because they might need more time ”to build a case.” He called the alleged delay ”very strange.” Trump tweeted Wednesday, ”Julian Assange said ’a 14 year old could have hacked Podesta’   why was DNC so careless? Also said Russians did not give him the info!” Trump said last week that he would receive an intelligence briefing on the Russian breaches this week and suggested it would come early on, telling reporters on New Year’s Eve that they would know more about the subject ”Tuesday or Wednesday.” But US intelligence officials disputed Trump’s tweet alleging a delay. Top US intelligence officials have been scheduled to brief Trump on the full report on Russian hacking President Barack Obama ordered once it was completed, but the meeting was not set to take place until later in the week, according to US officials. The meeting was never scheduled for Tuesday, as even Obama has yet to receive the   briefing on the Russian hacking, one US official said. And a US intelligence official told CNN that Director of National Intelligence James Clapper was never scheduled to be in New York City, where Trump is, on Tuesday    and was perplexed about the ”delay” Trump claimed was taking place. Trump on Tuesday did receive a classified intelligence briefing    the Presidential Daily Briefing    which Trump has elected to receive only sporadically. But it did not dive deeply into the Russian hacking. WikiLeaks’ Assange: Russia didn’t give us emails, US officials briefed on the matter said Clapper, National Security Agency Director Adm. Mike Rogers, FBI Director James Comey and CIA Director John Brennan are scheduled to attend the meeting with Trump providing him details on the Russian hacking. While Obama met with the heads of US intelligence agencies in his first weeks as   Trump has yet to do so eight weeks after he was elected, which US officials said was due to Trump’s scheduling conflicts. Instead, the   has repeatedly questioned their assessment of Russian cyber activity. Before the election, when 17 US intelligence agencies issued a public statement concluding that Russia orchestrated the hack of the Democratic National Committee, Trump immediately cast doubt on those conclusions, arguing it was impossible to distinguish between a Russian government operative and ”somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds.” After Obama then slapped a series of sanctions on Russia, Trump issued a statement calling for the country to ”move on to bigger and better things” and then tweeted praise for Russian President Vladimir Putin for not retaliating against the sanctions. Trump continued his skepticism on New Year’s Eve, telling reporters once again that it ”could be somebody else.” ”I know a lot about hacking. And hacking is a very hard thing to prove,” he said. He added that he also knows ”things that other people don’t know, so they can’t be sure of the situation.” On Tuesday, Russia again denied intervening in the US election campaign.  Reacting to a US intelligence official who told CNN the administration traced the hack to specific keyboards, which featured Cyrillic characters, Kremlin spokesman Dimitri Peskov said: ”I don’t understand what this means exactly but Cyrillic characters can be used everywhere.”  ”Once again I reject any possibility that official Russia can be involved in any way,” he added.  In December, Peskov said it was ”indecent” of the US to ”groundlessly” accuse Russia of intervention in the US election campaign. "
270,"Sally Bradshaw Quits GOP Over Trump, Will Vote Hillary Clinton",2016-08-01,"It’s always been all about amnesty for illegal aliens.  Sally Bradshaw, the senior adviser to former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush who   the Republican National Committee (RNC) autopsy report in 2013 calling for amnesty for illegal aliens, has quit the GOP and plans to vote for Hillary Rodham Clinton in November. Bradshaw in an interview with CNN said she has officially quit the Republican Party over Donald J. Trump becoming the nominee, saying the GOP is “at a crossroads and have nominated a total narcissist  —   a misogynist  —   a bigot. ” “This is a time when country has to take priority over political parties. Donald Trump cannot be elected president,” Bradshaw said. In the CNN interview, Bradshaw went as far as saying that not only has she quit the Republican Party but that she will vote for Hillary Clinton in November if the race is close in Florida. Bradshaw said: If the race in Florida is close, I will vote for Hillary Clinton. That is a very difficult statement for me to make. I disagree with her on several important issues. I have worked to elect Republicans to national and statewide offices for the last 30 years. I have never voted for a Democrat for president, and I consider myself a conservative, a supporter of limited government, gun rights, free enterprise, equality of opportunity. I am  . There are no other candidates who were serious contenders for the nomination that I would not have supported. It’s worth noting that Bradshaw, despite her claims to be a conservative, has been a longtime promoter of amnesty for illegal aliens. She, along with Henry Barbour of Mississippi, former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer, as well as Zori Fonalledas and Glenn McCall, wrote the RNC autopsy report which specifically called for the Republican Party to grant amnesty to illegal aliens. “We are not a policy committee, but among the steps Republicans take in the Hispanic community and beyond, we must embrace and champion comprehensive immigration reform,” the report   by Bradshaw read. “If we do not, our Party’s appeal will continue to shrink to its core constituencies only. We also believe that  comprehensive immigration reform is consistent with Republican economic policies that promote job growth and opportunity for all. ” That, of course, was the precursor to the Senate’s “Gang of Eight” immigration bill —  a bill that surely ended the   presidential prospects of Sen. Marco Rubio ( ) at least for now —  and then eventually the precursor to President Barack Obama’s executive amnesty. Obama, citing congressional disagreement on immigration after the Senate passed Rubio’s bill but the House didn’t, pushed forward with an executive action to grant amnesty to millions of the illegal aliens who would have been amnestied under the bill if the Congress hadn’t blocked the Senate bill. Republicans, running   against Obama’s executive amnesty in 2014, recaptured the U. S. Senate in a historic   swing toward the GOP. And this year, the U. S. Supreme Court rejected Obama’s executive amnesty on a   basis —  essentially upholding a lower court’s opinion against it. That means that 2016 is shaping up to be an election about amnesty, a referendum on whether such an executive amnesty like Obama’s is acceptable. Hillary Clinton would undoubtedly appoint Justices to the U. S. Supreme Court —  including the seat vacated by the passing of Antonin Scalia —  who would uphold the executive amnesty move, whereas Donald Trump would appoint Justices who oppose it. That means that the election in November is a clear choice between supporting executive amnesty and opposing it. And that’s ultimately why Bradshaw, who has in her   of helping the Bushes, especially Jeb Bush in pushing for amnesty, is going so hard against the Republican Party in favor of the Democratic nominee Clinton. Everything that Bradshaw has ever worked for is hanging in the balance: If the voters prove her incorrect by electing a Republican as strongly opposed to amnesty as Donald Trump is, that means her years of work in pushing Republicans to be more embracing of amnesty for illegal aliens are moot."
271,"Frontex Chief: 300,000 More Migrants Headed from Africa to Europe",2016-06-29,"The director of the agency for the control of the external borders of the European Union (EU) has predicted that as many as 300, 000 new migrants will be heading up from   Africa into Europe, most of whom will attempt to reach Italy as first port of call. [Fabrice Leggeri, the director of Frontex, said Tuesday that he based his estimates in part on recent surveys done in the Agadez region of  Niger, where   migration has reached 13 thousand persons per month.  “If migration flows from West Africa continue toward Libya, then we must expect some 300, 000 people fleeing this year from West Africa to the northern Maghreb, to then continue to travel to Europe,” he said in an interview with the German Funke media group. The director also expressed concern that an alternate route from Egypt has opened in the Mediterranean after the effective closing of the   Balkan route through Greece to Macedonia. With shifting migration patterns, 13 to 14 times more migrants are now traveling from Libya to Italy than from Turkey to Greece, he said. “The momentum is increasing. From April to May, the number of people fleeing to Italy doubled,” Leggeri noted, adding that the ethnic composition of the migrants has similarly shifted from the Middle East to Africa. “The majority of the asylum seekers are now coming from countries such as Eritrea in the Horn of Africa, where a brutal military regime is in power,” he said. “The numbers are increasing,” Leggeri said, noting that in just four days some 11, 000 migrants had been rescued in the Mediterranean, mostly in boats departing from Libya and heading to Italy. The Frontex chief also expressed his concern regarding the objective difficulty of the trip across the Strait of Sicily, the new preferred route for migrants trying to get to Europe. “It is a very dangerous crossing,” he said, “and it often takes more than ten days. There are few boats along this route available to assist migrants who are on sinking vessels. ” Last weekend, in fact, some 3, 000 migrants on board thirty different boats were rescued while attempting to make the crossing. “In all the time I spent in the central Mediterranean,” said one of the rescuers of Doctors Without Borders, “I’ve never seen anything like this, ever. ” The director of Frontex offered a grim overall evaluation of Europe’s migrant crisis, summing up EU immigration policy as a “failure. ” “The EU asylum policy has failed for a long time,” he said. “The EU countries are not even able to distribute the 160, 000 refugees proposed in 2015 by the Commission. ” “But the problem is: The migrants do not want to be distributed in EU countries. They have precise target countries such as Germany, where they want to go. This complicates a fair distribution of people in Europe,” he said. Follow Thomas D. Williams on Twitter   Follow @   <!

272,’28 Pages’ of Alleged Saudi Involvement in 9/11 May Be Out Friday,2016-07-14,"Sources told CNN that the famed “28 pages” from the congressional   report, detailing Saudi involvement in the terrorist attack, may be released to the public as early as Friday, ending 14 years of secrecy. [“The House Intelligence Committee will get the redacted report today or tomorrow,” said Rep. Adam Schiff ( ) a member of that committee. “The Senate and House intel committees should then give the formal go ahead to release the report since they originally produced it. ”  Such a release would be about a month behind the timetable envisioned in April, when President Obama said the pages would be released. It seemed for a while as if the Administration might change its mind, as former Senate committee chair Bob Graham ( ) said the White House stopped returning his phone calls in June, after the original deadline for a decision on releasing the pages had passed. By June 30, Graham had grown pessimistic that the documents would be released by the 15th anniversary of the   attack this September, but he told the Daily Beast he was gearing up for   war against Saudi Arabia, in the event the pages were released and the Saudis attempted to discredit them. But now CNN’s sources said all of the relevant agencies have agreed to release the 28 pages with “minimal redactions. ” The Administration’s hand might have been forced by bipartisan congressional pressure to pass a bill compelling the release of the documents. “My concern is the Saudis have big multiple guns to disparage the 28 pages when they come out and we need to be in a position to respond,” said Graham. He also said he was thinking about initiating a legal process, as a private citizen, that could force declassification. The Saudis’ attitude appears to have shifted over time, as they now say they would welcome the release of the 28 pages, so it can respond to any “unfounded” allegations contained within. One consequence of releasing the pages would be making it possible for the families of   victims to sue Saudi Arabia for its involvement in the attack. “All of this could be settled, if we would just release the 28 pages and let everyone see what’s in there. If it was just this    …     government officials in the Saudi Arabian government, then they have nothing to worry about. The American people deserve this just as much as the   families deserve it, but we’re the ones that are suffering by not having them released,” once such family member, Terry Strada, told CNN."
273,Anniversary of Sandra Bland’s Death Raises Tension Amid War on Cops,2016-07-13,"HOUSTON, Texas  —   One year ago today, Sandra Bland died in a small county jail cell just 25 miles northwest of Houston. The deaths of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile, the recent Black Lives Matter protests, and the execution of five officers in Dallas, have made the anniversary date even more concerning. [Sandra Bland is the young black woman who was found dead in a Waller County, Texas, jail cell three days after she was arrested by a Texas Department of Public Safety trooper (DPS). The police dashcam video of the traffic stop showed that the officer brandished a Taser and told her, “I’ll light you up. ” An autopsy ruled she committed suicide with a plastic bag.  Like Castile and Sterling, a video of the traffic stop and Sandra Bland’s arrest went viral. Castile and Sterling‘s events were also live streamed. Hearings were held in the Texas Capitol after her death to investigate and determine whether jail procedures and other changes should be made. Breitbart Texas was at the hearing when a conservative Republican State Representative, Jonathan Stickland ( ) told the DPS director  —   “A lot of people are afraid of you guys. ” The messages of hatred towards whites and the police were clear in chants of Black Lives Matter activists, and New Black Panther Party protesters who gathered at the small county jail in the weeks following her death. Breitbart Texas took the video that captured a group of   Black Panthers shouting “Off the Pigs,” and “Oink Oink   …     Bang Bang!” During one of the chants the group shouted in a back and forth   cadence: The revolution is on, said the chant leader. Off the pigs, the group chanted back. The chant continues, Time to pick up the gun   …     Off the pigs. No more pigs in my community  …     Off the pigs. No more brothers in jail   …     Off the pigs. No more sisters in jail   …     Off the pigs. The pigs are gonna get scared   …     Off the pigs. The pigs are gonna get dead   …     Off the pigs. Many of the members of the group were armed with shotguns, hunting rifles, and   style assault rifles. Deputies from the Harris County Sheriff’s Office were at the jail that day in large numbers. There were nearly 75 deputies, ten mounted deputies, a mobile command post, an observation aircraft, and a helicopter, all there to ensure the peace. Most looked like they were simply holding their weapon however, one of the Black Panthers took an aggressive grip on his weapon holding his rifle with his finger indexed slightly above the trigger. The sniper who killed the Dallas police officers was a member of the militant Houston New Black Panther Party. One of the members holding that   style rifle appears to be Micah Xavier Johnson, the suspect who was killed with a bomb after the sniper ambush of white police officers in Dallas. Breitbart Texas was at the Waller County jail for protests on another occasion and reported when a protester told reporters and others present, that all white people should be killed. She also called white people and reporters, “terrorists. ” Her orders  —   “go back into the cave where you came from. ” When asked whether she really believed that, she responded, “You’re damn right I do! You think I am scared to say that to you? !” “Sunshine” as she calls herself, said, “You see this   hair on my head?   …     That means I am one of those more militant Negroes. ” While she stood in front of the small county jail she added, “these redneck  **kers murdered Sandra Bland because she had nappy hair like me. ” Breitbart Texas took video at a large protest that became violent after a confrontation broke out between some of the protesters and Waller County Sheriff’s Office deputies. A group of people with the Black Lives Matter rally barged into the lobby of the sheriff’s office and jail and began shouting and pounding on windows and doors. The group had to be forcibly removed by deputies.  “Sunshine” took to her   radio show during these weeks and continued her propagation of hate speech against both whites and police. On her program, “Sunshine’s F***ing Opinion Radio Show,” people called in and demanded that people take to the streets in gangs and lynch white people and kill cops. The same day, another black man, Shannon Juraury Miles allegedly walked up to a uniformed Harris County Deputy Sheriff, Darren Goforth, and fired multiple rounds from a handgun into the back of his head. He continued firing his weapon into the deputy’s back as Goforth lay dying, and dead, on the ground. Officer Goforth’s execution came within less than two weeks of the calls for the killing of whites and cops by these Black Panther members and militant Black Lives Matter protesters. He was also murdered just thirty miles down the road from the Waller County jail. During a press conference in Harris County, Texas, after the Houston area deputy was executed, Sheriff Ron Hickman answered media inquiries as to the motivation of this alleged killer. “This rhetoric has gotten out of control. ” “We’ve heard ‘black lives matter,’ ‘all lives matter,’ well cops’ lives matter too,” said the leader of the third largest sheriff’s office in the country. The visibly emotional Hickman continued, “Why don’t we just drop the qualifier and say ‘lives matter.’ Take that to the bank. ” “At this point,” referring to the executed deputy, the sheriff said, “he was only targeted because he was wearing a uniform. ”   special prosecutors were appointed in the Sandra Bland case. The grand jury was also  . The trooper who arrested Bland, Officer Brian Encinia, was eventually indicted for misdemeanor perjury and was fired from his job. The grand jury did not believe Encinia’s statement in the probable cause affidavit where he said, “I had Bland exit the vehicle to further conduct a safe traffic investigation. ” This became the basis for the perjury charge. Two internal jail forms completed by Bland showed that although she alleged she had tried to commit suicide in 2014 after a miscarriage, she said she was not contemplating suicide at the time she was admitted into the Waller County jail. CNN also reported that an inmate who was in a cell adjacent to Bland told them she did not hear any commotion or screaming that would suggest foul play. The woman, Alexandria Pyle, also told CNN that, “She found out her bond was $5, 000, and no one  —   she was calling and calling  —   and no one was answering, and then after that she just broke down. She was crying and crying. ” After Bland’s death in the jail, Waller County Sheriff R. Glenn Smith immediately notified the Texas Rangers. He said the Rangers arrived within the hour of his notifying them. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) was also actively involved in an investigation. The Waller County Sheriff said he provided all documentation to outside investigative agencies. He also called for an independent investigation and the formation of an outside sheriff’s commission to evaluate jail procedures, jail personnel, and other issues. Neither Waller County Sheriff R. Glenn Smith or his jailers have been found negligent or complicit in Bland’s death. Smith was unable to talk to Breitbart Texas on the morning of the anniversary of Bland’s death because he was in depositions. As reported in early August, the mother of Sandra Bland immediately filed a federal civil rights lawsuit on behalf of herself and Bland’s estate.

274,"Justices, Seeking Compromise, Return Contraception Case to Lower Courts - The New York Times",2016-05-17,"WASHINGTON  —   The Supreme Court, in an unsigned unanimous opinion, announced on Monday that it would not rule in a major case on access to contraception, and instructed lower courts to consider whether a compromise was possible. The opinion is the latest indication that the Supreme Court, which currently has eight members, is exploring every avenue to avoid    deadlocks, even if it does not decide the question the justices have agreed to address. The case concerned an accommodation offered to religious groups that did not want to offer insurance coverage for contraception to their female employees as ordinarily required by regulations under the Affordable Care Act. The accommodation allowed the groups not to pay for coverage and to avoid fines if they informed their insurers, plan administrators or the government that they wanted an exemption. Insurance companies or the government would then pay for the coverage. Some religious groups objected, saying that providing the required notice still made them complicit in what they considered to be sinful conduct. The court’s unusual opinion tried to bridge the gap between the two sides, suggesting that the government could arrange to provide coverage to the religious groups’ female workers without requiring any notice or other action from the groups. Such a solution would require the two sides to agree on many details and would probably require new federal regulations. The justices’ decision to insert themselves into the adversarial process, acting more like mediatiors than judges, was almost certainly a consequence of the disarray that followed Justice Antonin Scalia’s death in February. Since then, the court has deadlocked three times, including in a major case on public unions. In other cases, it has found consensus through narrow rulings, some of which decided very little. Monday’s opinion nullified decisions in appeals courts around the nation, all but one of which had upheld the accommodation. Both sides said they were pleased. “The Supreme Court was right to protect the Christian colleges and other groups from having to pay fines or fill out forms authorizing the objectionable coverage,” said David Cortman, a lawyer with Alliance Defending Freedom, which represents some of the groups challenging the accommodation. “The government has many other ways to ensure women are able to obtain these drugs without forcing people of faith to participate in acts that violate their deepest convictions. ” The White House also said it welcomed the decision. “It will allow millions of women across the country to continue to get the health coverage that they need,” Josh Earnest, the press secretary, told reporters. He said the White House was “gratified” because the decision proved it was possible to prioritize health care access while maintaining religious liberty for everyone. President Obama, in an interview with BuzzFeed News, said the opinion was notable for what it said about the state of the Supreme Court. “I won’t speculate as to why they punted,” he said, “but my suspicion is that if we had nine Supreme Court justices instead of eight, there might have been a different outcome. ” Republican senators have said they will not confirm another of Mr. Obama’s Supreme Court nominees. The court signaled its direction less than a week after the case was argued in March, when it issued an unsigned order asking the parties to submit supplemental briefs on a possible compromise. In Monday’s ruling, the court said that those briefs suggested a compromise was possible but that it should be forged in the lower courts. “Given the gravity of the dispute and the substantial clarification and refinement in the positions of the parties, the parties on remand should be afforded an opportunity to arrive at an approach going forward that accommodates petitioners’ religious exercise while at the same time ensuring that women covered by petitioners’ health plans ‘receive full and equal health coverage, including contraceptive coverage,’ ” the court said, quoting from a brief filed by the government. The Supreme Court urged the lower courts to “allow the parties sufficient time to resolve any outstanding issues between them. ” The justices emphasized that they were deciding nothing. “The court expresses no view on the merits of the cases,” the opinion said. “In particular, the court does not decide whether petitioners’ religious exercise has been substantially burdened, whether the government has a compelling interest, or whether the current regulations are the least restrictive means of serving that interest. ” Justice Sonia Sotomayor filed a concurrence, which was joined by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, underscoring the limited nature of the action and cautioning lower courts not to read anything into it. “Today’s opinion does only what it says it does: ‘affords an opportunity’ for the parties and courts of appeals to reconsider the parties’ arguments in light of petitioners’ new articulation of their religious objection and the government’s clarification about what the existing regulations accomplish, how they might be amended and what such an amendment would sacrifice,” Justice Sotomayor wrote. “As enlightened by the parties’ new submissions, the courts of appeals remain free to reach the same conclusion or a different one on each of the questions presented by these cases. ” The case, Zubik v. Burwell, No.   was the court’s second encounter with the contraception requirement and the fourth time it had considered an aspect of the Affordable Care Act. It built on a case from 2014, Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, which said a regulation requiring   corporations to pay for insurance coverage for contraception violated a federal law protecting religious liberty. Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. writing for the majority in 2014, said there was a better alternative, one that the government had offered to nonprofit groups with religious objections. Many religious groups around the nation challenged the accommodation, saying that objecting and providing the required information would make them complicit in conduct that violated their faith. The groups, which include hospitals and schools, added that they should be entitled to the outright exemption offered to houses of worship like churches, synagogues and mosques. Houses of worship are not subject to the coverage requirement at all and do not have to file paperwork if they choose not to provide contraception coverage. At the arguments in March, several justices indicated that they thought the accommodation violated the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act because it allowed the government to “hijack” the insurance plans of the religious groups that were the petitioners in the case. Days later, the court called for more briefs in an order that asked the parties to “address whether and how contraceptive coverage may be obtained by petitioners’ employees through petitioners’ insurance companies, but in a way that does not require any involvement of petitioners beyond their own decision to provide health insurance without contraceptive coverage to their employees. ” The order sketched out how this might work, asking the two sides to address whether it would be acceptable for the groups to do no more than buy insurance plans for their workers that did not include contraception coverage. On Monday, the court said that the unusual tactic had worked and that both sides “now confirm that such an option is feasible. ” The religious groups, the court said, quoting their brief, “have clarified that their religious exercise is not infringed where they ‘need to do nothing more than contract for a plan that does not include coverage for some or all forms of contraception,’ even if their employees receive   contraceptive coverage from the same insurance company. ” “The government,” the court continued, “has confirmed that the challenged procedures ‘for employers with insured plans could be modified to operate in the manner posited in the court’s order while still ensuring that the affected women receive contraceptive coverage seamlessly, together with the rest of their health coverage.’ ”"

278,"Held Hostage in an Orlando Restroom, and Playing Dead to Stay Alive - The New York Times",2016-06-16,"ORLANDO, Fla.  —   As the sound of gunfire in the nightclub grew louder, a patron named Orlando and a female friend took cover in a cramped bathroom stall, contorting their bodies on top of the toilet so their feet could not be seen. The gunman burst into the bathroom, went straight to the stall next to them and shot the people inside. “People were screaming, begging for their lives,” Orlando, 52, said in a telephone interview, asking that his last name not be used out of fear of retaliation from terrorist sympathizers. The gunman, Omar Mateen, was silent, then left the bathroom. “He went out and started shooting outside again,” Orlando said. For three sickening hours on Sunday morning, a    game of deception played out in a bathroom where the assailant holed up with hostages after killing dozens of people inside the Pulse nightclub. Orlando and his friend desperately tried to avoid becoming two more victims. Orlando said he listened as the gunman warned his hostages not to text anyone, took their cellphones, called 911 to calmly pledge his allegiance to the Islamic State, spoke about a need to stop American bombing in Syria and threatened greater bloodshed if the police moved in. Orlando described moments of surreal quiet as the siege went on and the killer fiddled with his weapon and used the sink and the hand dryer. Mr. Mateen checked on the bodies around him, Orlando said. At one point, Orlando switched positions and played dead, and he felt something poking him. He believed it was the gunman, checking to see if he was dead. Around 5 a. m. the police blew a hole in the wall, enabling some of the hostages to escape, and officers engaged in a fatal final confrontation with the assailant. Much of Orlando’s account corresponds with new information released by the police on Monday, other witness accounts and video evidence, which combined to paint a chilling picture of the hostage crisis that unfolded after the attack. The first bursts of gunfire, around 2 a. m. were captured on video by    Amanda Alvear, the footage uploaded to Snapchat. In the video, she is recording herself and others as they dance to the last song of the evening at the popular gay club. Then she turns the camera toward her own face. She is staring into the lens as the first few shots are heard. They do not seem to faze her. But as they continue, unrelenting, roughly 20 rounds, the video abruptly ends. She was listed among the dead on Monday. Just before the shooting began,    Ashley Summers and her friends went to their bartender, Kate, at Pulse’s back bar to order one more round  —   a vodka, soda and lime for Ms. Summers a vodka and Red Bull for one friend and a specialty drink for the other. One of Ms. Summers’s friends was polishing the credit card receipt with all sorts of pleasantries for the bartender  —   “sexy kitten,” “muah,” “you the best”  —   when the popping started. For 15 seconds, through the pulsing of the salsa music, they thought it might have been firecrackers, Ms. Summers said in an interview. But they eventually figured out it was gunshots. Ms. Summers said a friend pulled her to the ground. They felt glass shattering over their heads. They were near a back exit and crawled out. Concerned about what might be behind the    white privacy fence out back, they turned left, into a storage area. But they heard more gunshots coming from that direction, so they went back out onto the patio and used some furniture to vault over the fence. They dashed to safety. “At that point it was shock, it was disbelief, it was fear, but it was urgency,” said Ms. Summers, a ballroom dance instructor. “There was knowing that we had to get out of there. ” Soon after Mr. Mateen first opened fire, he was confronted by an armed security guard who was an   police officer, said John Mina, the Orlando police chief, at a news conference Monday morning. They exchanged gunfire. The security guard was then joined by an unknown number of police officers, the first to arrive on the scene. During these early rounds of gunfire, the police said, many patrons were able to escape. But the assailant retreated deeper into the club, eventually barricading himself in the bathroom, where some patrons had gone to hide. When the shots erupted, Norman Casiano dropped to his knees and crawled to what was apparently a different bathroom, seeking safety in a stall where many people were already crammed together. He tried to call 911, then his mother, shouting, “Mom mom mom mom!” into the phone before the call dropped. As Mr. Casiano, 25, and the others huddled together, a wounded man staggered into the bathroom and dropped to the floor. They urged him to try to stay quiet. At one point, as the gunman approached, Mr. Casiano said, he could hear shells clattering to the floor and the gun reloading. Then Mr. Mateen entered the bathroom. “Just firing, firing, firing,” Mr. Casiano said in an interview at his parents’ apartment, about two hours after he was released from the hospital on Monday afternoon. He was hit once in the back and felt a hot pulse of pain tear into him, as if his leg had been severed. He ended up being shot twice in the back, both bullets passing through his body, he said. Mr. Casiano said the gunman did not say anything, but laughed as people begged him not to shoot and assured him that they did not know who he was and had not seen his face. “All I heard was a laugh,” Mr. Casiano said. “He laughed like an evil laugh, something that’s just going to be imprinted in my head forever. ” It was, he said, “a laugh of like, ‘Ha, I did it. ’” When the gunman left the bathroom, Mr. Casiano tried to urge others to leave, he said, and was able to slip away and escape. He said he was in a hospital bed by about 3 a. m. two hours before the siege ended. Orlando’s escape took much longer. Hiding with his friend, he could hear the gunman drawing closer, the sound of each round getting louder. As he and his friend positioned themselves on the toilet, Orlando said, he also braced one foot against the stall door. Around this time, Mina Justice was asleep at home when she received a text from her    son, Eddie Justice, she told reporters. He was also hiding in a bathroom at the club. “Mommy I love you,” the first message read. It came in at 2:06 a. m. “In club they shooting. ” Only two minutes later, he wrote, “I’m gonna die. ” Another 30 minutes would pass before he sent a text begging for help. “Call them mommy,” he pleaded. “Hurry,” he wrote. “He’s in the bathroom with us. ” Orlando said he never looked Mr. Mateen in the eye, but recalled his calm voice. At one point, after noticing that some of the hostages in the bathroom were texting, the gunman ordered them to surrender their phones. He spoke again, according to Orlando, asking the hostages, “Are you guys black?” “He said, ‘I don’t have an issue with the blacks,’” Orlando said. Early in the siege, the gunman called 911 to pledge his allegiance to the Islamic State, Chief Mina said. “He was cool and calm when he was making those phone calls to us,” he said. Orlando could hear the gunman speaking on the phone, presumably to the police. He spoke about how America should stop bombing the Islamic State. “He got mad and hung up,” Orlando said. He never heard Mr. Mateen mention gay people  —   he spoke only about the Islamic State and Syria, and about the damage he still intended to do. The gunman made several calls, and at one point, Orlando said, he told whoever was on the other line that there were people in the club with bombing vests as well as three snipers outside, ready to take out officers if they advanced on the club. “Our negotiators were talking with him, and there were no shots at that time,” Chief Mina said. “But there was talk about bomb vests, about explosives, throughout, and there were statements made about imminent loss of life. ” Near the end of the siege, Mr. Mateen began to shoot the hostages in the bathroom, Orlando said. By some miracle, he said, he once again avoided detection, but a person in the neighboring stall was not so lucky. A man who had just been shot crawled under the stall, grasping at both Orlando’s and his companion’s legs, pulling them down  —   and exposing their hiding spot. They played dead, “my face against the toilet bowl,” he said. In those moments, Orlando’s phone would not stop ringing, as friends called to see if he was safe. He worried that the rings would draw attention and give him away. As the final battle with the police began, Orlando could hear the gunman loading his weapon, at one point shouting, “I’ve got plenty of bullets. ” Then there were explosions and chaos. The police had blown a hole in the bathroom wall, but Orlando said his muscles were so cramped he could barely move. “My shoulders got caught,” he said. “A cop grabbed me and pulled me out through the hole. ” His female friend was also rescued. When he looked at his clothes, he was covered in blood, but it was not his own. He does not know if anyone else made it out of the bathroom alive. Mr. Justice, whose last text to his mother was just before 3 a. m. did not survive. His death was confirmed by the Orlando authorities early Monday morning."

[Four out of the five games sitting at the top of Steam by average player count per hour were there last year as well. Dota 2,  : Global Offensive, Team Fortress 2, and Grand Theft Auto V were at #1, #2, #4, and #5 respectively in 2015.

280,Gas Prices Lowest for This Time of Year Since 2005 - Breitbart,2017-06-10,"The average gasoline price nationwide is the cheapest it has been at this point in the year since 2005, according to GasBuddy, a site that monitors gas prices. [The national average for gasoline is now $2. 35 as of Friday —  a   drop this week and two cents less than it was in 2016 at this point in the year.  Prices were lower Friday than in 2016 in 23 states, but states such as Kentucky, Ohio, Illinois, Michigan, Indiana, and Wisconsin see the most pronounced drop in prices. The New York Times reported that the cause of this major dip in price was due to the Energy Department’s report that U. S. inventories of crude oil and gasoline surged a week before, despite a heavy travel Memorial Day weekend, when lots of cars were on the road. On Wednesday, crude oil went down five percent and plunged to less than $46 a barrel, a price that is close to a   low. The drop in price is striking given that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) decided to cut production this year, and Saudi Arabia recently cut ties with Qatar for supporting terrorism Monday. But this drop in oil prices is not expected to last forever. Energy experts say the low gasoline prices will only last for a few weeks because of high demand during the summer months. If oil prices stay low, prices will eventually go up even higher because of less oil production. “This is a slump, a buying opportunity, and Americans can enjoy it,” said Tom Kloza, energy analysis head of Oil Price Information Service. “But I think it is a little bit of an anomaly, and I expect to see higher crude oil prices in the second half of the year. ”"
281,"The Worldwide Trumpian Majority: Lessons from Brexit, Britain, and the United States - Breitbart",2016-08-07,"Second of three parts. [1. Lessons from Brexit,  In Part One of this series, we chronicled a tale of two cities: the   Republicans in Cleveland, and the establishment —  some would say elitist —  Democrats in Philadelphia. Yes, it’s obvious that there’s a gap between the two, maybe more like a chasm. So now we will begin to examine the divide between nationalism and globalism, focusing on the nationalist eruption in the United Kingdom. But perhaps the reader has noticed the title of this series: “The Emerging Trumpian Majority. ” And one might ask: How can we have an “Emerging Trumpian Majority” if, as the MSM stoutly insists, Donald Trump’s candidacy is doomed? First off, Trump is not doomed. Despite a hellaciously bad week, the latest Reuters poll shows him down a mere three points. Moreover, the news on August 6 that there was yet another jihadi attack, this time in Belgium, reminds us that the conjoined issues of immigration and homeland security will remain paramount through November —  and that’s good for Trump. Indeed,   Americans might ask: What’s Hillary Clinton’s plan, other than more of the Obama status quo? We can further say: It’s only a matter of time before someone does an ad morphing Clinton’s face with that of Germany’s Angela Merkel —  two peas in the same   pod. Second, we can observe that   trends are favorable to nationalists, such as Trump, and unfavorable to globalists, such as Clinton. And we can illustrate these two points with a compelling case study from another   country with overlapping politics: the UK. Over there, all the big shots, and their pollsters and MSM enablers, were convinced that the June 23 referendum on “Brexit” —  that is, British exit from the European Union (EU) —   would lose. Indeed, the “Remain,” or “Bremain,” forces had huge advantages: Virtually the entire UK elite, and all their financial and media muscle, were arrayed on behalf of staying in the EU. And yet, of course, Brexit won. That’s a good reminder: Money and media are meaningful, but in a democracy, votes matter more. Indeed, the degree to which the UK establishment was flummoxed by Brexit is astounding. The polls were virtually unanimous that Brexit would lose —  and they were all wrong. For example, on the day of the election, the YouGov poll, the supposed benchmark for Britain, had Brexit losing by four points. And yet Brexit won by four points. In other words, an   error. Indeed, a former president of YouGov, Peter Kellner, predicted Bremain would win by 8. 5 percent. Even the supposedly savvier betting portals were wrong, too: 76 percent wagered on Bremain. 2. British Politics as a Leading Indicator for American Politics, If we study UK politics, we notice something interesting: Elections across the Atlantic have a way of anticipating American elections. For example, in 1951, Winston Churchill was returned to Number 10 Downing Street. A little more than a year later, here in America, another World War Two hero, Dwight Eisenhower, was given the keys to the White House. Similarly, Margaret Thatcher was elected to the prime ministership in 1979 the following year, Ronald Reagan won the presidency. So now, as we think about the 2016 presidential election, we can readily see that the same   forces that powered Brexit to victory —  and pushed the globalist incumbent, Prime Minister David Cameron, out of office —  are at work here in the US. So does the win of Brexit portend a win for Trump? Trump himself seems to think so speaking of the UK, he tweeted on June 24, “They took their country back, just like we will take America back. ” Of course, the US election is still three months away so in the meantime, all we can do is study the tea leaves —  including the English tea leaves. In particular, the rise and fall of the EU, in the eyes of Britons, tells us a lot. Not so long ago, in 1975, the British people were asked to vote on whether or not the UK should join the EU, then known as the European Community. The result was a better than 2:1 victory for joining. Among the supporters of “join” were Margaret Thatcher, the leader of the opposition Conservative Party, not yet Britain’s prime minister. Yet over the decades, as the EU grew in size and ambition, it became increasingly controversial. Originally it was a just a trade zone, but then, over time, it became a political entity —  a   “United States of Europe. ” And that growth —  some would say, metastasis —  was more than Thatcher, stalwart English patriot that she was, could abide. So she became a “Euroskeptic,” that is, a critic of the EU. Yet the majority in her party, mostly bewitched by the promise of export opportunities to the EU’s enlarging market —  and some also beguiled by the prospect of being part of a new European empire —  remained firmly in the   “Europhile” camp. The widening split between Thatcher and her fellow Conservatives came to crisis in 1990, when the Iron Lady was deposed in an   putsch. Ever since, under Thatcher’s successors at Number 10, the   “Project” of European integration has continued one of the main features was the opening of national borders and the instantiation of unlimited travel within the EU. Yes, there was opposition to the EU Project, but it was small and fragmented. And yet fatefully, in 1993, Nigel Farage helped to found the UK Independence Party, UKIP for short. So now, let’s fast forward to 2015. Thatcher had passed away, but Euroskepticism was on the rise across Britain. So the staunchly   David Cameron, seeking to mollify Euroskeptics before his own   that year, felt compelled to promise a referendum on the EU: the Brexit vote. In the actual 2016 Brexit campaign, Cameron went all out he even brought his good friend Barack Obama over to London to help his Bremain campaign. And the American president dutifully threatened Britain with economic oblivion if it Brexited. Yet Obama’s venture into foreign politics seems to have boomeranged UKIP’s Farage reacted sharply: “Obama came to Britain and I think behaved disgracefully. ” Meanwhile, Cameron   kept up the pressure till the very end. Everything that could go wrong, the Bremainers pledged, would go wrong. Yet all this   seems to have further hurt Cameron’s cause as one observer wrote in Foreign Policy: It did not help matters that all Cameron could offer, in response to the Leave campaign’s promise to “take back control” and restore British parliamentary sovereignty, was a parade of “experts” —  ranging from the World Bank and the IMF to Barack Obama —  all of whom warned against leaving the EU. Experts, too, are out of fashion in Britain. “We are about democracy, they are about economics” said Johnson, while Michael Gove, a former key Cameron ally turned impassioned Leave campaigner, remarked that “I think people in this country have had enough of experts. ” Of course, there were at least some experts on the other side, including Ambrose   the influential columnist for The Telegraph, who warned his fellow Britons: The EU as constructed is not only corrosive but ultimately dangerous, and that is the phase we have now reached as governing authority crumbles across Europe. The Project bleeds the lifeblood of the national institutions, but fails to replace them with anything lovable or legitimate at a European level. It draws away charisma, and destroys it. This is how democracies die. The hottest single flashpoint, of course, was immigration. And the issue wasn’t just immigration into the UK it was also immigration into the EU, because under EU rules, once in, a European, old or new, can go anywhere —  and collect welfare benefits. It was telling, for example, that on June 23, the day of the Brexit vote, 4500 Africans reached Italy —  and the next day, probably 4500 more. So of course Brexit won. Now the left is reeling. It has an ideological commitment to open borders, but it also has a practical commitment to winning elections. And yet it can’t have both. Stanley Greenberg, a veteran pollster for both US Democrats and the UK Labour Party, observed after the vote, “The biggest rationale, and the strongest arguments, were opposition to immigration. ” So what to do? In the US, at least, the   Democrats have embraced a dubious strategy, doubling down on open borders, including public assistance to any and all newcomers we’ll have to see how that works out for them. In the meantime, now that Brexit has won, we might take note of those, in addition to Farage, who were early prophets. One such is Robert Tombs, professor of history at Cambridge University, who in 2015 was quoted in Breitbart London, describing the EU in the direst possible terms: There is a soft push to create a sense of European citizenship which is based on frankly an invented common history because the history of Europe is to a large extent the history of division, not the history of unity. When it has been the history of unity, as we’ve seen under Napoleon and Hitler or under the Soviets in Eastern Europe, it has gone disastrously wrong. It is a papering over the discordant elements in European history to create this idealized event. That was last year, before the vote, when Tombs was mostly confined to   venues. This year, after the vote, Tombs was invited to write a long   in the   magazine The New Statesman, which is obviously groping to understand the new political facts on the ground. Still as piercing as ever, Tombs noted, “The only professional groups that strongly voted [for Bremain] were big business, the liberal professions and academics. ” Continuing, Tombs sniped: “Europe is now being governed by neither its peoples nor its ideals, but by a bank board. ” And then he added this   description of the tactics used by the Bremainers: They have been out of touch and out of sympathy with opinion in the country, unwilling or unable to engage in reasoned debate, and resorting to collective proclamations of institutional authority which proved embarrassingly ineffective. And Tombs was no kinder to the Bremain forces after the vote: The reaction to the referendum result by some Remain partisans has been a monumental fit of pique that includes talking up economic crisis (which, as Keynes showed, is often  ) and smearing 17 million Leave voters as xenophobes. This is both irresponsible and futile, and paves the way to political marginalization. So now Britain is led by Prime Minister Theresa May. Interestingly, she herself was a Bremainer, albeit a quiet one. And yet in the   power struggle, the Brexiteers managed to neutralize each other, clearing the path for May. Yet since taking office on July 13, she has wrapped herself in the popular will as she has said many times, “Brexit is Brexit. ” We might also note that May stands for more than just Brexit, and that, too, is powerful. She stands also for a conservative tradition that is patriotic, unifying, and, yes, solidaristic. Stylistically, she is nothing at all like Trump, but nevertheless, the two have something in common: In their devotion to their respective nations, we see a deep commitment to something powerful —  the renewal of shared nationalistic values. Indeed, we can further say that May and Trump share some common intellectual ancestors, and one of them, in particular, is worth examining. 3. “One Nation” Conservatism, On the day she took office, May started out with a   bang. Appealing to the forgotten man and forgotten woman of the UK, May spoke to them directly. And her language was about more than just tax cuts: The mission [is] to make Britain a country that works for everyone  …     If you’re from an ordinary working class family, life is much harder than many people in Westminster realize. You have a job but you don’t always have job security. You have your own home but you worry about paying the mortgage. You can just about manage, but you worry about the cost of living and getting your kids into a good school. If you’re one of those families, if you’re just managing, I want to address you directly. And then she did just that: When we take the big calls, we’ll think not of the powerful, but you. When we pass new laws, we’ll listen not to the mighty, but to you. When it comes to taxes, we’ll prioritize not the wealthy, but you. When it comes to opportunity, we won’t entrench the advantages of the fortunate few, we will do everything we can to help anybody, whatever your background, to go as far as your talents will take you. Some might say that May sounds like a populist, but that’s a misreading of the   PM. She isn’t saying that the mass, or the mob, should rule she’s saying, instead, that wise leaders, having won a popular mandate, should rule —  and rule with the   of the people first in mind. As such, May summons up the ghost of one of Britain’s greatest conservative leaders, Benjamin Disraeli, prime minister for seven years and an important figure in British politics for four decades. It was Disraeli, back in the 19th century, who outlined the idea that has guided the Tory Party, at its best, ever since: “One Nation Conservatism. ” Born in London in 1804, Disraeli was horrified by the impoverished conditions of the English working class, and yet he was horrified also by the thought of French   radicalism coming to his country and soaking it in blood. Seeing that     conservatism was destined to fail in the face of industrialization, urbanization, and proletarianization, Disraeli picked up his pen he wrote not only political pamphlets, but also novels that mixed   intrigue with a reformist message. Elected to Parliament in 1837, Disraeli articulated his One Nation idea, championing policies —  and more to the point, an overall approach —  that he believed would not only quell revolution but also bring the English working class into the Tory fold. Disraeli described English workingmen as “angels in marble. ” That is, they were natural Tories, in terms of basic attitude so just as a sculptor, confronting a block of solid rock, chisels away everything that’s not an angelic form, so, too, would One Nation Tories carve out new voters from the lower levels of English society. In no sense was Disraeli a redistributionist leftist. Yet still, by seeking to assure at least a minimum for all, Disraelites believed that the rich and the poor could be bonded together in the unifying sentiments of patriotic nationalism. A     later, May is talking that same Disraelite language. Earlier this month, after repeating, once again, her resolve to move ahead on Brexit, she called for a unifying economic agenda: We need a proper industrial strategy that focuses on improving productivity, rewarding   people with higher wages and creating more opportunities for young people so that, whatever their background, they go as far as their talents will take them. We also need a plan to drive growth up and down the country —  from rural areas to our great cities. To be sure, the words “industrial strategy” will rankle some on the right, because they sound like “industrial policy,” and that’s anathema to   purists. And without a doubt, conscious economic development is sometimes a mess, even if the Japanese, Chinese, and South Koreans have done a good job of making it work —  and other countries have, too. 4. Lessons from the U. S. for the U. S. In the past, adhering to the ideas of our first treasury secretary, Alexander Hamilton, the US has also emphasized One Nation economic development —  and with great effect: The Erie Canal was an industrial strategy. So was the Transcontinental Railroad and, for that matter, all the railroads. So, too, was the Tennessee Valley Authority, jet aviation, the Interstate highways, the Internet, and GPS. The typical pattern was that the government would   the idea, and then the private sector would take over, reaping profits and creating jobs. Still, it can’t be denied that a politicized development program will include some inefficiencies —  although one man’s inefficiency, of course, is another man’s job. And this is where politics comes in: If an area or region is afflicted by hard times, what’s the right answer? Is it to tell the folks to move to where the jobs are? Yet what if that’s Mexico or China? No, a better way is to take advantage of local resources and build something valuable, such as, say, Hoover Dam. Completed in the 1930s, Hoover Dam to this day provides   hydropower to much of the Southwest, thereby enabling tens of millions of Americans to make a living in what would otherwise be desert. And if that’s inefficient from a purist point of view, well, too bad: As US history proves, we can live with that much “inefficiency. ” What we can’t live with, however, is a country in which whole states and regions are left behind, in the dust. Indeed, tolerance for a degree of   “inefficiency” just might be the only way for the right to win. That is, the right must occupy the   bringing in     voters. We can quickly see: If there’s a center that needs to be occupied in order to win elections, it can be occupied by either the   or the  . After all, in a big country, there’s no such thing as pure   or pure   governance. And what’s most imperative is keeping the greens and the multiculturalists out of power. If the right fails to do that, we end up with Obama’s America —  or Hillary’s America. In fact, today, it’s an open question as to whether or not the   coalition —  greens, multiculturalists, plus George Soros and Al Sharpton —  are even interested in economic growth and development. So that’s a huge opportunity for Republicans, should they choose to seize it. Seizing it, of course, would require a return to the Hamiltonian policies that guided such Republican presidents as Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt, and Dwight Eisenhower. Finally, we can add this: Today, “efficiency,” which in theory is good, seems to have become, in political parlance, a codeword for the hegemony of the Wall Street and Silicon Valley. The ascendancy of billionaires might, in some dry economistic way, be a sign that markets are equilibrating, that is, working well. But in practice, such a    ascendancy equals losing politics for incumbents. To put the matter another way, a political and economic system in which the losers vastly outnumber the winners is not a viable system —  at least not in a democracy. And of course, questions of efficiency beg the further questions of whether or not financial bubbles are an inherent part of “efficiency” —  and also, we might note, whether or not “efficiency,” as understood by Silicon Valley, means PC thought control. 5. Nationalism vs. Globalism, Yes, Brexit won, and that means that the nationalists won. And yet, the globalists are attempting to deny that victory. This is not surprising the EU, after all, has built up its own culture of   and Eurocrats can’t be expected to change their mind just because the voters have spoken. For instance,   Juncker, President of the European Commission (an appointed, not elected, job, by the way) insists that there will be no retreat on open borders, within and without Europe. Just last month, under the headline, “Juncker: No Matter How Bad Migrant Crisis, Terrorism Gets, We’ll Never Give Up On Open Borders,” Breitbart London reported: The President of the European Commission is not just committed to open borders within Europe. Under his presidency, the European Commission lists migration as one of its priorities. As well as offering residency to the world’s “refugees” the Commission seeks to make it much easier and more desirable for Africans and their families to move to EU countries. Speaking after Islamic terror attacks left 130 dead in Paris last November, Mr. Juncker rejected calls to rethink the EU’s open doors policy on migration from Africa and the Middle East. Dismissing suggestions that open borders led to the attacks, Mr. Juncker said he believed “exactly the opposite” —  that the attacks should be met with a stronger display of liberal values including open borders. We can pause to note that the   EU, that melange of 28 countries and a population totaling nearly 500 million, paying top salaries to hundreds of thousands of technocrats, has indeed developed its own “gravity’’ —  even if it’s mostly     and bankers who feel the attraction. Moreover, as the historian Michael Lind has observed, the globalists seek to extend the EU model to the world: For multicultural globalists, national boundaries are increasingly obsolete and perhaps even immoral. According to the emerging progressive orthodoxy, the identities that count are subnational (race, gender, orientation) and supranational (citizenship of the world). While not necessarily representative of Democratic voters, progressive pundits and journalists increasingly speak a dialect of ethical cosmopolitanism or globalism —  the idea that it is unjust to discriminate in favor of one’s fellow nationals against citizens of foreign countries. Indeed, the globalists are so invested in this model that Brexit came as a stunning shock. It was as though the Russian White forces had overthrown Soviet leader V. I. Lenin and his new Red Utopia and restored the Romanov Czars. Indeed, some Europeans today, probably most, lean toward   insurgency. One such is Marine LePen, leader of the National Front in France. All along, she has defined the battle as a fight between “globalists” and “patriots. ” After Brexit, she tweeted, “Victory for freedom!” Continuing, she called for similar referenda in France and all the EU countries. Of course, any referendum on the EU is exactly what the Eurocrats wish to avoid the last time the EU put something to a vote in France, back in 2005, it lost resoundingly. Hence the lesson learned by the elite, although not by Cameron: No more referenda. In the meantime, the elite has focused on smearing LePen and her growing National Front party. So we’ll have to see whether or not the French patriots can overcome the EU’s “democracy deficit” and pull off a “Frexit. ” In the meantime, the EU itself, and its actions, are continuing to stoke   sentiment. Exhibit A, of course, is the   policy. After a string of   attacks in Germany, a local newspaper, Bayernkurier, operated by a conservative political party, was moved to declare: “Angela Merkel’s policies have been a stimulus package for   populists. ” Indeed, we can step back and see that around the world, the dueling forces are globalism, on the one hand, and nationalism, on the other. Globalism, as we have observed, is a curious combination of socialism and capitalism —  that is, bureaucrats and bankers, working together to flatten national boundaries and, indeed, to flatten the   itself. As an aside, there’s a good reason why New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman chose to entitle his 2005 book, The World Is Flat —  it’s what he wants to see happen. As for nationalism, that’s the credo of all others, whether we like them or not. Trump, Farage, and LePen are nationalists, but then so, too, are the Russians, Chinese, and Iranians. In other words, just about all the peoples of the world are instinctive nationalists it’s globalism that is the strange mutation, afflicting mostly the West. So we’ll take up the challenge of sorting out the good from the bad in the next installment. ### Next: Nationalism vs. Globalism in America"

283,Huffington Post Declares Megyn Kelly Victor-and Victim - Breitbart,2016-01-29,"The Huffington Post has declared Megyn Kelly the victor of Thursday night’s presidential debate with a   spread cheering her combative handling of the Republican candidates gathered in Des Moines, Iowa. [“KELLY STEALS THE SHOW,” the main headline reads, with a link to the Washington Post blog “The Fix. ” The opinion article, by Callum Borchers, calls Kelly “charming” and “fantastic. ”  Sorry, Donald Trump. But Megyn Kelly is a fantastic debate moderator. There was no avoiding it, and Fox News Channel didn’t really try: Megyn Kelly was the star of the show at Thursday’s Republican presidential debate in Des Moines.   …     This is the Kelly magic: she can be confrontational and charming all at once. It’s easy to argue with a journalist no one likes, but it’s much tougher to pick a fight with one who so easily wins over the viewers you hope to turn into your voters. The spread of   under a photo of Kelly continues rounding up reactions from other publications: “Crushes The Debate [Salon]  …     ‘Demolishes’ Cruz, Rubio [Vanity Fair]  …     Trump Giving America Permission To Hate Women [HuffPost Women]  …    ” The final link in this layout, from Huffington Post Executive Women’s Editor Emma Gray, still depicts Kelly as a victim —  while the other publications’ descriptions such as “fearless” and “strong. ” Gray writes: Despite Kelly’s   conservative views, she has become a target of Trump’s misogyny  …     The 2016 election has huge implications for American women. Calling Kelly a “bimbo” is just a symptom of a much larger  —   and scarier  —   problem. Because when misogyny is amplified at the highest levels of our political system, that misogyny is legitimized. Ted Cruz called out Kelly after the debate for comparing Donald Trump —  who boycotted the debate for his own rival broadcast across town —  to the Harry Potter villain Voldemort while the cameras weren’t rolling. Kelly did not deny the charge on air."
284,El Paso HS Nixes Legendary Coach Lou Holtz as Guest Speaker for Immigration Comments,2016-08-29,"El Paso’s Cathedral High School disinvited legendary NCAA football coach Lou Holtz as their   gala guest speaker for describing immigration as an invasion and opining that immigrants need to learn how to assimilate better. [Inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 2008, the    icon served as the head coach for six NCAA football teams including Notre Dame and the University of South Carolina, compiling a career record of 249 —  132 —  7.  Last Month at the Republican National Convention, during a luncheon celebrating the GOP nomination of real estate mogul Donald Trump, Holtz referring to immigrants remarked:“I don’t want to speak your language, I don’t want to celebrate your holidays, I sure as hell don’t want to cheer for your soccer team. ” According to the El Paso Times, Holtz confessed, subsequently, that he wishes he never made the comment. Wednesday the president of the Council of Presidents at Cathedral, David Saucedo, confirmed in an email that the beloved coach and TV football analyst would not be speaking at the October 20 school gala and fundraiser. Luis Villalobos, a 1963 graduate of Cathedral High School, claims that the alumni did the “right and courageous thing” by reversing their August 18th decision to invite Holtz. In a letter to the editor of the El Paso Times, he wrote: “Public figures have to know, even during this election time, their words have consequences. They can speak before a very enthusiastic crowd, but they can’t say things that are insulting to any group, whether it be a minority group, women or whatever group they are railing against. ” Villalobos believes that the   winner of the Paul “Bear” Bryant Award took the “wrong road” when he made the comments about immigrants.  “Imagine the impact the coach’s words would have had if he had spoken about inclusion or if he would have spoken about being merciful and accepting of all people in this country and instead of dividing, uniting people? His comments would have been incredibly impactful,” Villalobos opined. An editorial by the El Paso Times applied pressure on the Cathedral alumni when it stated that the high school’s leaders “made an unfortunate decision” by picking Holtz to speak at the gathering geared to raise funds for future scholarships. “Holtz is a highly successful football coach, but his hateful words last month run counter to many of the principles that have made Cathedral such an important part of the El Paso community,” the paper stated.  Tuesday, the day before he rescinded the invite to Coach Holtz to share his words of wisdom at the fundraiser, President Saucedo expressed a different point of view in a letter to the Times: “[T]he negative, vitriolic response to Coach Holtz from some in our community has been shocking and is, equally, unbecoming. ” He added, “It’s difficult to persuade, or at least attempt, to change one’s mind on immigration if you immediately shun them. We love the concept of free speech, up until there is disagreement, then we are quick to slander and smear those individuals. ”"
285,Study Says Kids Understand Smartphones Better Than Real Life - Breitbart,2016-06-27,"An online study performed by digital security company AVG Technologies claims children are more proficient in operating a smartphone than in completing basic everyday tasks. [According to AVG Technologies, 58% of children aged between 3 and 5 can successfully operate a smartphone but fewer than 1 in 6 can perform simple tasks such as making their own breakfast. Tim Elmore, founder of Growing Leaders, a non profit organisation based out of Georgia that works with schools and civic groups to promote leadership qualities in children, said, “I see many parents doing everything for their kids instead of letting them figure out how to fend for themselves. ”  Understandably many skills such as   a letter have slowly become less important in our modern world due to the rise of technology however skills such as cooking, cleaning, and navigating are still relatively essential. Parenting experts suggest that parents spend time with their kids, teaching them how to develop skills that can be used in day to day life as well as fostering a healthy interest in other aspects such as gardening. It’s long been claimed by older generations that technology has limited the ability of children to communicate effectively. While there may be downsides such as limiting creativity and affecting sleep patterns, by allowing children to use this technology, we must also be realistic in our understanding of how fast technology is progressing these days and how essential it has become in day to day life.  As with all things, and especially with children, moderation and supervision is very much needed.

286,Russia’s space program in crisis?,2015-06-03,"Moscow (CNN) Ever since the Cold   space race with the United States, Russia has taken immense national pride in its cosmic exploits. It was a Soviet satellite    Sputnik 1    that was the first, in 1957, to break out of Earth’s gravitational grip. 1960 witnessed the first living creatures make it into orbit and back again. Soviet space dogs, Belka and Strelka, are still widely celebrated for their achievement    although the memory of the grey rabbit, 42 mice, two rats, and numerous flies that accompanied them on their extraterrestrial journey has faded. The following year, in 1961, a Soviet cosmonaut pipped the Americans into space. Yuri Gagarin became a household name and a potent symbol of what the Kremlin would have seen as Communist superiority over the West. But in recent years that confidence has been challenged by a catalogue of embarrassing setbacks. In April, Russian ground staff lost control of an unmanned cargo spacecraft on a supply mission to the International Space Station. Contact was never   with the $30 million Progress 59 freighter, which was sent spinning at terrific speeds before burning up over the Pacific Ocean. Last month, another Russian rocket mission, this time carrying a Mexican satellite, went wrong minutes after launch from the Baikonor Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. It crashed in Siberia, raising more questions about the reliability of Russia’s space program. Some commercial satellite operators have already started to take their business elsewhere. Battered reputation  For decades, Russia has been a byword for reliability in space technology. Solid,   equipment has been the mainstay of space exploration. But recently, the reputation has taken a severe battering. And not just in space, but on the ground as well. READ: $1. 8B disappears in Russian space program  There’s the case of the Vostochny Cosmodrome in the Russian Far East    a new   launch site. It’s the country’s biggest construction project, costing nearly $6 billion and designed to blast Russia’s space program into the 21st century. But it’s mired in scandal. There have been numerous   corruption probes into missing funds.  And there has even been a hunger strike by unpaid workers. One of the disgruntled workers was permitted to personally ask the Russian President to intervene in the dispute, during a nationally televised   event earlier this year. Vladimir Putin assured him and the country, that the problems would be ironed out. ”We’ll take it under our double control, you on the site and I here from Moscow,” he said. ”All the   in the construction and pay delays are absolutely inadmissible and will certainly not be tolerated.” But analysts of the Russian space program say the real problem goes far deeper than a few construction holdups. Funding for space exploration has been slashed. But it’s the prestige    not the financing    of the old Soviet program that is missed most. Lack of ambition, Unlike the Soviet program, critics say Russia’s space industry lacks ambition. There are no trips to Mars on the horizon, no exploration of deep space planned. And unless that changes, the Best of the Best    the scientists and the engineers    may choose to stay away, and Russia’s dream of reviving the glories of its   past may never truly blast off."
287,Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe Stands with Planned Parenthood,2017-02-21,"Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe says a bill that would have prohibited his state from entering into contracts with Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers “would harm tens of thousands of Virginians,” reports ABC7. [As expected, McAuliffe vetoed a bill that would have allowed Virginia to redirect Medicaid funding from abortion providers such as Planned Parenthood to other federally qualified healthcare centers (FQHCs) that are more numerous and provide more comprehensive care.  During a veto event outside the executive mansion Tuesday, McAuliffe said the mansion was the “brick wall” protecting women’s health care, says a report at Richmond  . “It’s important for women to have access to quality health care,” the governor said. “This is what matters to Virginia families today. ” ”We are here today because I’m going to veto senate bill 2264.”  —  @TerryMcAuliffe #IStandWithPP pic. twitter.   —     (@PPMW_ACT) February 21, 2017,  In his remarks, McAuliffe also likened North Carolina’s bathroom privacy law to the bill he vetoed as another example of discrimination that could harm Virginia’s business interests. “Discrimination breeds hatred and we will not tolerate that in the commonwealth of Virginia,” he said. “We treat everyone equally, with dignity and respect. ” Planned Parenthood tweeted its celebration of McAuliffe’s veto of the bill: It’s a great day to have @GovernorVA as a Planned Parenthood supporter. #HB2264 has been vetoed! pic. twitter.   —   PPAVirginia (@PPAVirginia) February 21, 2017,  The legislation was sponsored by Del. Benjamin L. Cline (R) and passed the state Senate last week on a   vote. “This important legislation would have prioritized taxpayer dollars toward providers of more comprehensive health care services, and the governor’s veto undermines those efforts to improve health care in rural and underserved areas,” Cline said in a statement. Democrat leaders, however, defended Planned Parenthood. “Attacks on Planned Parenthood do nothing to advance health care,” said Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring (D). “They take us in the wrong direction. ” Lt. Gov. Ralph S.  Northam (D) who is making a bid for governor, took the “war on women” approach by saying lawmakers, “most of whom are men,” should let women decide what to do with their bodies. Nevertheless, Olivia Gans Turner, president of the Virginia Society for Human Life, said in vetoing the bill, McAuliffe placed “the abortion lobby” before “the women and unborn children of the commonwealth. ” A similar bill prohibiting Medicaid funds to any abortion provider passed the Virginia state legislature last year. In a strong show of support for Planned Parenthood, McAuliffe went to the abortion business’s facility in Richmond itself to veto the legislation. The Virginia Bureau of Watchdog. org reported that Planned Parenthood contributed more than $1. 7 million to McAuliffe’s gubernatorial campaign in 2013. Abortion industry lobbying organization NARAL donated $56, 000 to his campaign, as well. Federally qualified healthcare centers (FQHCs) provide many more services to   families than Planned Parenthood does. Nationally, there are 13, 000 FQHCs  —   a figure that outnumbers Planned Parenthood facilities 20 to 1. Despite the overwhelming number of FQHCs, however, Democrats who are often supported by the abortion lobby claim that by redirecting funding away from Planned Parenthood, states are preventing   individuals from accessing health care."
288,"The Women Who Met Hillary, and Spotted a Future Political Star - The New York Times",2017-04-07,"It is too soon to know whether the unexpected outcome of Hillary Clinton’s presidential candidacy will inspire more women to run or dampen their aspirations. But either way, it is clear that she has, through her campaigns and career, helped create a political environment in which a woman could come so close to winning the presidency. What is less known is that Mrs. Clinton started changing that political culture for women as far back as the early 1970s  —   not through a candidacy of her own, but through a series of small, but crucial, networking moves. The number of women who labored in basement meetings, in   groups, in boardrooms, in unions, in news organizations and in their own kitchens to expand possibilities for women are far too many to count. Far fewer, however, worked specifically to put women into elected office. Prominent among those who did were a few key friends of Mrs. Clinton whom she helped find paths to the cause, including a Texan political player named Betsey Wright, who Mrs. Clinton introduced to a classmate of hers from Wellesley College, Jan Piercy. “In 1972, I was working at a temporary job at Filene’s Basement, trying to figure out what I was going to do next, when I got a call from Hillary,” recalled Ms. Piercy, who had devoted herself to antipoverty work at Wellesley, but not to feminism, per se. “And Hillary said, ‘We have to go to Washington tomorrow.’ So we jumped on a plane, and I’m ushered in to the National League of Women Voters headquarters, and Hillary tells them, ‘This can be your youth director. ’” Ms. Piercy, representing the league, went on to attend the Republican and Democratic conventions in 1972, a key inflection point for female activists. “We realized that the only way we could be accepted as equals was to be in office,” she said. “But the parties were not interested in cultivating women. So we realized we would have to train them ourselves. ” Ms. Piercy was too inexperienced to do that so was Elisabeth Griffith, another friend of Mrs. Clinton’s and Ms. Piercy’s from Wellesley, who had joined Ms. Piercy in the early stages of a project with that ambition. But while Mrs. Clinton was a law student supporting the presidential candidate Senator George McGovern in San Antonio, she met Ms. Wright, the person she thought could galvanize and prepare potential female candidates. She soon became close to Ms. Wright, a seasoned political operative whose experience of sexism on the McGovern campaign was having a somewhat radicalizing effect on her. Often when Ms. Wright tried to raise an issue with a male staff member on the campaign, “It elicited some kind of crazy response about hormones,” Ms. Wright, now 73, recalled. “I was already a feminist, but that turned me into a raving feminist. I would go home and play Helen Reddy and go to sleep. ” Bill Clinton, who helped coordinate McGovern’s Texas campaign, had his own feminist aha moment while working on the race, when McGovern’s staff did not pursue Mrs. Clinton for a job for which Mr. Clinton had recommended her. “But she’s better than me,” he told Ms. Piercy at the time. In meeting Mrs. Clinton, Ms. Wright said, she no longer just imagined a woman could be president, but believed she had met the very woman who would first reach that milestone. Many friends tried to talk Hillary out of marrying Bill for the sake of her political future Ms. Wright went so far as to try to talk Bill out of marrying Hillary, for the sake of the feminist cause. “I told him it was always going to be a struggle for her to carve her own political direction,” Ms. Wright said. Ms. Wright had previously worked on individual women’s campaigns. Yet it was Mrs. Clinton who suggested that Ms. Wright move to Washington to spread her expertise, by joining Ms. Piercy and Ms. Griffith to work for what would become known as the National Women’s Education Fund, an unofficial training arm of the National Women’s Political Caucus, with no formal affiliation. “Hillary was saying they really did need to get somebody who understood local races,” Ms. Wright said. “And she strongly urged me to go. ” It was not an easy sell: Mrs. Clinton was asking Ms. Wright, a Texan, to move to Washington for a job that did not yet have the funding to support it. But persuaded by Mrs. Clinton, Ms. Wright ultimately accepted the position of executive director, backed by a national board of women working in politics. Ms. Wright recalled driving around a frigid Midwest in the winter of 1973, “sleeping in bunk beds at Y. W. C. A. s, with the bathroom down the hall,” trying to recruit women from local churches, gardening clubs and political caucuses for seminars and training sessions that Ms. Wright created to teach women how to maneuver within the political process. She also formed a powerful partnership with Ruth Mandel, who had recently created the pioneering Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University. It was not just that they needed to train women, Ms. Mandel said they needed to “help women overcome their own resistance to gaining political power in their own right. ” Ms. Wright knew that revolutions start with pragmatics: She created a training manual that the Education Fund and the Political Caucus relied on heavily for years, a guidebook that broke down the logistics of opinion polling, reaching the news media and recruiting a staff. The training sessions offered advice on every aspect of campaigning, including details specific to women. “We told them, ‘Put your name tag high up on your right lapel, so people could see your name without staring at your chest,’” said Ms. Griffith, who was associate director under Ms. Wright. They also told women, Ms. Wright remembered, “Never to say anything in a ladies’ bathroom you don’t want to see in a newspaper. ” Vivian Houghton, now a    Democratic political activist in Delaware, attended a training session in the  ’70s that gave her the confidence, she said, to run several women’s campaigns at the state and local level. Eventually, in 2005, she ran for attorney general of Delaware, for the Green party. “From that training, we carried out a message that women were just as competent or even more competent than men to run for office,” Ms. Houghton said. “And it gave us the instructions on how to do it, because we were at that point completely uneducated about it. ” Judith Lichtman, a senior adviser to the National Partnership for Women and Families, recalled that in 1974, “the N. W. E. F. was already an important presence on the scene. ” She credited Ms. Wright for that: “She turned the glimmer of an idea into an institution that catapulted untold numbers of women into public life. ” But she credits Mrs. Clinton with pairing the right political powerhouse with the right cause. “She had a   moment,” Ms. Lichtman said. “That was pretty early for that light bulb  —   not a lot of people were thinking about women in politics. ” Ms. Wright’s political talents were such that she became the chief of staff for Bill Clinton when he was governor of Arkansas. “In the Capitol, you had to go through Betsey if you wanted to drink a glass of water,” said Sara Ehrman, the Clinton friend who famously drove Hillary Rodham to Arkansas. But the role Ms. Wright played in Mr. Clinton’s 1992 presidential primary has largely overshadowed the work for which she was once well recognized within the women’s movement. It fell to Ms. Wright, the proud,   raving feminist, to squelch what she once called, dismissively, the “bimbo eruptions” that threatened to derail Mr. Clinton’s candidacy. “It was my job to defend the Arkansas record and Bill Clinton personally,” Ms. Wright said. As for the derogatory phase she coined, she said, “That was just a brain freeze, and it’s something I’ll go to my grave regretting I ever said. ” The race “tore Betsey apart,” said Ms. Piercy, who saw that her friend’s role was significantly limited once the campaign team made it past the primary. “Betsey was there in the beating heart of a   presidential campaign, before we fully understood exactly what it meant for women to be in the cross hairs of that kind of power,” Ms. Piercy said. Ms. Wright is still hopeful that a Democratic woman will be elected president in her lifetime. Certainly, the prospect is far from the pipe dream it seemed like when she first met Mrs. Clinton. “I told Hillary I thought she could be president,” Ms. Wright said. “She would just laugh. Back then, it was pie in the sky. ” Out of politics for years, Ms. Wright is now contemplating ways she could once again engage in causes in Texas, where she has been dismayed by, among other things, the state’s decision to ban Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood. “I have to do something,” she said. “We have to create a sense of outrage  —   to get more women elected, and to scare the hell out of the men who are there. ”"
289,Everybody is missing the point of the Tesla-SolarCity deal,2016-06-28,"’  ’ ”   Last week,  the troubled   leasing company that is   run by Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s cousin Lyndon Rive. ” ’   And on Monday, SolarCity said it had formed a committee of   independent directors to evaluate the deal. ’ ’   That is because Musk is the largest single shareholder of both   companies and the chairman of SolarCity. ’ ’   Holy conflict of interest! ’ ’   Actually, Musk and Rive have said they will recuse themselves   from voting on the deal. ’ ”   Anyway, SolarCity is a $3 billion bite for Tesla in an     transaction that would add   brace yourself   over $3 billion in   debt to Tesla’s balance sheet. ” ”   If this looks like a SolarCity bailout   the company has seen its   market cap, now $2. 25 billion, sawed in half since last year     then that’s because it is. ” ”   The deal might look outwardly vexing, and much of the analysis   has suggested that Tesla is doing something wrong here,   but it’s not. It’s actually following through on promises that   Musk has made over and over for the past half decade. ” ’  ’ ’   So why is Tesla doing this? ’ ”   It certainly doesn’t seem to be to enhance shareholder value.   Tesla stock dived when the news broke. ” ’   But it has never been clear that Tesla cares much about   shareholder value. ’ ”   Rather than please investors or vindicate the ratings and target   prices of Wall Street analysts, the   maker is playing   a longer game. The stock just helps it get there by providing a   way to raise capital, as it did recently and also last year, and   to be used as a form of super currency to sustain Musk’s vision   of a world freed from   dependency. ” ’  ’ ”   SolarCity is integral to that vision, even if it’s Musk’s most      interest   it’s hard to compete with the car of   the future and a SpaceX mission to Mars. ” ”   And that’s what everybody is missing here. ” ’   With this bid, Tesla is trying to become what Musk probably   wanted it to be all along: an integrated holding company   providing   solutions. ’ ’   If the SolarCity deal goes through, then Tesla will be a   carmaker; a battery maker, thanks to the Gigafactory being built   in Nevada; an energy storage company, thanks to Tesla Energy,   unveiled last year and selling residential battery packs; and a   solar finance firm. ’ ’   Put all that together under one roof and you get a company that   can sell or lease you a      lifestyle. ’ ”   Plus, Musk rescues his SolarCity investment in the process. But   there’s nothing surprising here in the master plan. Musk has   always thought of the companies he’s involved with as a single   mega investment. It makes sense to use the stock of one to keep   another one going. ” ’   Yes, all that debt could eventually be a major problem for Tesla.

290,Foundation Ties Bedevil Hillary Clinton’s Presidential Campaign - The New York Times,2016-08-26,"The kingdom of Saudi Arabia donated more than $10 million. Through a foundation, so did the    of a former Ukrainian president whose government was widely criticized for corruption and the murder of journalists. A   developer with vast business interests contributed as much as $5 million. For years the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation thrived largely on the generosity of foreign donors and individuals who gave hundreds of millions of dollars to the global charity. But now, as Mrs. Clinton seeks the White House, the funding of the sprawling philanthropy has become an Achilles’ heel for her campaign and, if she is victorious, potentially her administration as well. With Mrs. Clinton facing accusations of favoritism toward Clinton Foundation donors during her time as secretary of state, former President Bill Clinton told foundation employees on Thursday that the organization would no longer accept foreign or corporate donations should Mrs. Clinton win in November. But while the move could avoid the awkwardness of Mr. Clinton jetting around the world asking for money while his wife is president, it did not resolve a more pressing question: how her administration would handle longtime donors seeking help from the United States, or whose interests might conflict with the country’s own. The Clinton Foundation has accepted tens of millions of dollars from countries that the State Department  —   before, during and after Mrs. Clinton’s time as secretary  —   criticized for their records on sex discrimination and other   issues. The countries include Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Kuwait, Oman, Brunei and Algeria. Saudi Arabia has been a particularly generous benefactor. The kingdom gave between $10 million and $25 million to the Clinton Foundation. (Donations are typically reported in broad ranges, not specific amounts.) At least $1 million more was donated by Friends of Saudi Arabia, which was   by a Saudi prince. Saudi Arabia also presents Washington with a complex diplomatic relationship full of strain. The kingdom is viewed as a bulwark to deter Iranian adventurism across the region and has been a partner in the fight against terrorism across the Persian Gulf and wider Middle East. At the same time, though, American officials have long worried about Saudi Arabia’s suspected role in promoting a   strain of Islam, which has some adherents who have been linked to violence. Saudi officials deny any links to terrorism groups, but critics point to Saudi charities that fund organizations suspected of ties to militant cells. Brian Fallon, a spokesman for the Clinton campaign, said the Clintons and the foundation had always been careful about donors. “The policies that governed the foundation’s activities during Hillary Clinton’s tenure as secretary of state already went far beyond legal requirements,” he said in a statement, “and yet the foundation submitted to even more rigorous standards when Clinton declared her candidacy for president, and is pledging to go even further if she wins. ” Mrs. Clinton’s opponent, Donald J. Trump, could face his own complications if he becomes president, with investments abroad and hundreds of millions of dollars in real estate debt  —   financial positions that could be affected by moves he makes in the White House. And on Friday, Paul Manafort resigned as chairman of the Trump campaign, in part because of reports about his lucrative consulting work on behalf of   Ukrainian politicians. Still, Mr. Trump has seized on emails released over the past several weeks from Mrs. Clinton’s tenure as secretary of state, in which a handful of donors are mentioned. He has attacked her over an email chain that showed Douglas J. Band, an adviser to Mr. Clinton, seeking to arrange a meeting between a senior American government official and Gilbert Chagoury, a   real estate developer who donated between $1 million and $5 million. Mr. Chagoury explained through a spokesman that he had simply wanted to provide insights on elections in Lebanon. Some emails and other records described donors seeking and in some cases obtaining meetings with State Department officials. None showed Mrs. Clinton making decisions in favor of any contributors, but her allies fear that additional emails might come out and provide more fodder for Mr. Trump. Craig Minassian, a spokesman for the foundation, said the decision to forgo corporate and foreign money had nothing to do with the emails. The foundation will continue to raise money from American individuals and charities. “The only factor is that we remove the perception problems, if she wins the presidency,” he said, “and make sure that programs can continue in some form for people who are being helped. ” But Tom Fitton, the president of Judicial Watch, a conservative group that has sued to obtain records from Mrs. Clinton’s time at the State Department, said that “the damage is done. ” “The conflicts of interest are cast in stone, and it is something that the Clinton administration is going to have to grapple with,” Mr. Fitton said. “It will cast a shadow over their policies. ” And in an election year in which a majority of Americans say they do not trust Mrs. Clinton, even some allies questioned why the foundation had not reined in foreign donations sooner, or ended them immediately. A Bloomberg poll in June showed that 72 percent of voters said it bothered them either a lot or a little that the Clinton Foundation took money from foreign countries while Mrs. Clinton was secretary of state. In a   International Poll the same month, 38 percent of voters said Mr. Clinton should completely step down from the foundation, while 60 percent said he should be able to continue working with the foundation if his wife became president. Mr. Clinton said Thursday he would leave the foundation’s board if Mrs. Clinton won. Edward G. Rendell, a former Democratic governor of Pennsylvania, said the foundation should be disbanded if Mrs. Clinton wins, and he added that it would make sense for the charity to stop taking foreign donations immediately. “I think they’ll do the right thing,” Mr. Rendell said, “and the right thing here is, without question, that the first gentleman have nothing to do with raising money for the foundation. ” Mr. Minassian said ending foreign   before other sources of money could be found, and without knowing who will win the election, could needlessly gut programs that help provide, for instance, H. I. V. medication to children in Africa. Begun in 1997, the foundation has raised roughly $2 billion and is overseen by a board that includes Mr. Clinton and the couple’s daughter, Chelsea. Mrs. Clinton joined when she left the State Department and stepped down in 2015 before beginning her campaign. Its work covers 180 countries, helping fund more than 3, 500 projects. Having a former president at the helm proved particularly productive, with foreign leaders and business people opening their doors  —   and their wallets  —   to the preternaturally sociable Mr. Clinton. Among the charity’s accomplishments: Its Clinton Health Access Initiative  —   which is run by Ira C. Magaziner, who was a White House aide involved in Mrs. Clinton’s failed effort to overhaul the health care system in her husband’s first term  —   renegotiated the cost of H. I. V. drugs to make them accessible to 11. 5 million people. The foundation helped bring healthier meals to more than 31, 000 schools in the United States, and it has helped 105, 000 farmers in East Africa increase their yields, according to the foundation’s tally. In December 2008, shortly before Mrs. Clinton became secretary of state, Mr. Clinton released a list of more than 200, 000 donors to defuse speculation about conflicts. Soon after, Mrs. Clinton agreed to keep foundation matters separate from official business, including a pledge to “not participate personally and substantially in any particular matter that has a direct and predictable effect upon” the foundation without a waiver. The Obama White House had particularly disliked the gatherings of world leaders, academics and business people, called the Clinton Global Initiative, that the foundation was holding overseas. The foundation limited the conferences to domestic locations while Mrs. Clinton was secretary of state. On Thursday, Mr. Clinton said the gathering in September in New York would be the foundation’s last. One of the attendees at these conferences speaks to the stickiness of some donor relationships. Victor Pinchuk, a steel magnate whose    Leonid Kuchma, was president of Ukraine from 1994 to 2005, has directed between $10 million and $25 million to the foundation. He has lent his private plane to the Clintons and traveled to Los Angeles in 2011 to attend Mr. Clinton’s   65th birthday celebration. Between September 2011 and November 2012, Douglas E. Schoen, a former political consultant for Mr. Clinton, arranged about a dozen meetings with State Department officials on behalf of or with Mr. Pinchuk to discuss the continuing political crisis in Ukraine, according to reports Mr. Schoen filed as a registered lobbyist. “I had breakfast with Pinchuk. He will see you at the Brookings lunch,” Melanne Verveer, a   then working for the State Department, wrote in a June 2012 email to Mrs. Clinton. A previously undisclosed email obtained by Citizens United, the conservative advocacy group, through public records lawsuits shows the name of Mr. Pinchuk, described as one of Ukraine’s “most successful businessmen,” among those on an   list of influential people invited to a dinner party at the Clintons’ home. Earlier in 2012, Ambassador John F. Tefft wrote to Mrs. Clinton about a visit to Ukraine by Chelsea Clinton and her husband, Marc Mezvinsky, “at the invitation of oligarch, Victor Pinchuk. ” Mrs. Clinton replied, “As you know, hearing nice things about your children is as good as it gets. ” In July 2013, the Commerce Department began investigating complaints that Ukraine  —   and by extension Mr. Pinchuk’s company, Interpipe  —   and eight other countries had illegally dumped a type of steel tube on the American market at artificially low prices. A representative for Mr. Pinchuk said the investigation had nothing to do with the State Department, had started after Mrs. Clinton’s tenure and been suspended in July 2014. He added that at least 100 other people had attended the dinner party at Mrs. Clinton’s house and that she and Mr. Pinchuk had spoken briefly about democracy in Ukraine. A deal involving the sale of American uranium holdings to a Russian   enterprise was another example of the foundation intersecting with Mrs. Clinton’s official role in the Obama administration. Her State Department was among the agencies that signed off on the deal, which involved major Clinton charitable backers from Canada. There was no evidence that Mrs. Clinton had exerted influence over the deal, but the timing of the transaction and the donations raised questions about whether the donors had received favorable handling. Even if Mr. Clinton steps down, there could be remaining complications about a potential president’s name being affixed to an international foundation. And Chelsea Clinton, who is its vice chairwoman, would continue her leadership role. “It is very difficult to see how the organization called the Clinton Foundation can continue to exist during a Clinton presidency without that posing all sorts of consequences,” said John Wonderlich, the interim executive director of the Sunlight Foundation, a government watchdog group in Washington. “What they announced only addresses the most egregious potential conflicts. ” Considering the scale and scope of the foundation, Mr. Wonderlich said it was easy to “name a hundred different types of conflicts. ” The reality is, he added, “there are no recusals when you are president. ”"
291,"Robert Creamer Sues James O’Keefe, Project Veritas over 2016 Sting - Breitbart",2017-06-02,"Robert Creamer and his Democracy Partners consulting group sued conservative filmmaker James O’Keefe and his Project Veritas on Thursday in the District of Columbia for $1 million. [The lawsuit concerns an O’Keefe sting that exposed Creamer’s efforts to incite violence at Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign rallies to create a sense of “anarchy” around the candidate.  O’Keefe’s work revealed that Creamer and his associates, who worked with the Democratic National Committee, were involved in a tactic called “” which involved provoking Trump supporters to lash out at them, and to film those reactions, with footage to be distributed to media outlets. The Project Veritas team also showed a Creamer associate describing a complex communications system he referred to as the “Pony Express,” which Democrats used to circumvent rules against coordination between political campaigns and super PACs. O’Keefe’s work resulted in Creamer being forced to step aside from his campaign activities  —   and also exposed his close connections to the Obama White House. Arguably, his reporting shifted the momentum in the campaign. Creamer’s   complaint alleges that O’Keefe and Project Veritas “selectively edit   …     videotapes so as to distort and misrepresent what was said,” and complains that their efforts unfairly interfered with Democrats’ efforts to wreak havoc on the Trump campaign. The complaint also alleges: “The [Project Veritas] video was heavily edited and contained commentary by O’Keefe that drew false conclusions from the selectively edited videos, to charge that Plaintiffs were involved in a conspiracy to incite violence at rallies for   Donald Trump  …    ”. As a result of O’Keefe’s exposés, Creamer’s complaint alleges, Democracy Partners lost valuable business contracts from   political clients. Creamer and his company are seeking damages for alleged unlawful interception of oral communications, for civil conspiracy, and for fraudulent misrepresentation, among other torts. O’Keefe responded with a statement: Robert Creamer believes that by suing us, he can intimidate us. I will not be silenced  —   only over my dead body! We are on the right side of the law and will not stop exposing the truth.   …     This lawsuit further justifies the need to drain the swamp. Our army of guerrilla journalists, which grows daily, will continue to expose the malfeasance and corruption committed by these organizations. In fact, we will be deploying a new batch of freshly trained journalists next week to shine additional light on the cockroaches of the corrupt DC establishment. We will not be intimidated. We will not be silenced. We will find out who is funding this lawsuit. We will never stop exposing the truth. We will not back down. Project Veritas attorney Benjamin Barr added: “The First Amendment protects the rights of undercover journalists to expose exactly the sort of corruption captured in these videos. Veritas will assert its full First Amendment rights to defend itself in these proceedings. ” Joel B. Pollak is Senior    at Breitbart News.

292,’This is an extreme’: Dog found with ears and nose cut off,2017-01-19," (CNN) Kathy Bilitzke has become sadly familiar with animal abuse since she began working at the Michigan Humane Society about four months ago. But she still wasn’t ready for what she saw Tuesday after a call from a concerned citizen came in to the Cruelty Hotline. The dog’s ears had been cut off. His nose, too. He had a stump tail. And there were lacerations to the backs of his legs. ”We don’t see this type of abuse, thankfully, regularly,” Bilitzke, the Michigan Humane Society’s director of marketing and communication, told CNN. ”This is an extreme.” That abuse was enough for the Michigan Humane Society to take to Facebook with a call to action. The group posted a blurred photo of the disfigured dog, a brown and tan Rottweiler, and offered a $2, 500 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the person responsible for the abuse. ”It appears that someone purposely maimed this poor dog, which has caused it a great deal of suffering,” Mark Ramos, one of Michigan Humane Society’s lead cruelty investigators, said in a statement. ”This kind of cruelty is unacceptable.” That post has spurred a reaction of outrage and sympathy, and a number of users have asked to adopt the dog. Stable but not yet healthy, The dog has since received medical treatment and is in stable condition. Still, Bilitzke said he’s not yet healthy enough to be put up for adoption. ”At this point it’s too early to say what the course of action will be,” she said. ”But because he is stable, we are encouraged.” In an interview with CNN affiliate WDIV, Ramos said the dog appeared to be well socialized and behaved. ”He gets along with everybody that he’s encountered so far,” Ramos said. ”And despite his injuries, he still has a fantastic attitude.” Though he doesn’t yet have a permanent home, the animal does now have a name: Baron. ”He needs a name,” Bilitzke said. ”We want to give him a voice, so he needs a name.”"
293,Election night isn’t a party for presidential transition staff,2016-11-07,"Washington (CNN) Away from the balloon drops of victory and somber concessions of defeat on election night, a small club of political animals will be watching under very different circumstances. For the few hundred people who have been working for Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump’s transition efforts, the results of the election either mean the beginning of some of the most intense months of their life    or the end of a heap of prep work that heads to the shredder. They have spent the past several weeks feverishly drafting options for what a Trump or Clinton administration would look like, assembling names for potential appointments, figuring out how to execute policy promises and drawing up an agenda for the first 100 days in office.   The winners have to keep in mind they’re working bright and early the next morning. ”I remember on election night I could not go to Chicago and watch the victory party because were we to win, I would have to open the transition office next morning,” recalled Christopher Lu, President Barack Obama’s transition executive director.  What is a presidential transition? He said he watched the returns from DC.  ”I recall being at a bar up on Capitol Hill and people asked me what I did, and I said I worked for Sen. Obama and I think they all said, ’Why aren’t you in Chicago? ’” said Lu, now the deputy secretary of Labor. ”I remember shortly after the race was called at 11 p. m. on election night, I got a phone call from the head of the General Services Administration,. .. ’We have certified that Barack Obama is the   of the United States and we essentially give you keys to a federal building and access to federal funding,’” Lu said. ”While everybody was celebrating, I knew that the next morning I had to get up and open an office at 9 a. m. and so your election night certainly has a different tone than the other people who you’re working with.” That sentiment was echoed by Clay Johnson III, who oversaw the transition of President George W. Bush. Like Lu    who has known Obama since law school    Johnson is an old friend of Bush’s, going back to their high school days at at Andover.  Johnson said Bush charged him with planning for a future administration in June 1999    16 months before it would happen. So election night was basically a confirmation of a mindset he had held for months.  ”The campaign people, their work is over, so they are besides themselves with jubilation and just so happy,” Johnson said. ”Election night, when the person’s successful, only confirms the mindset that the transition people have had for the last three, four, five months, that this candidate is the person that’s going to be the next president of the United States. That’s nice. That’s happy. I’m glad for them, but meanwhile, let’s get back to work.” ”Maybe they’ll have an extra cocktail or two or congratulate their campaign buddies,” Johnson continued, ”but their time to celebrate is Inauguration Day. . .. There’s a little deferred gratification for the transition people.” All that hard work. .. If the 2016 transitions are following the example of their predecessors, there is likely already a rough agenda for a potential   Clinton or Trump on November 9.  ”At 3 o’clock on the day after the election, we were scheduled to begin decisions on who the president’s White House staff should be, who the national security team should be and who the Cabinet members should be,” said Mike Leavitt, the former Utah governor who chaired Mitt Romney’s transition in 2012.  Trump transition fundraises with email from Christie, But Romney lost, and Leavitt experienced the flip side of transition watching: the heartbreak.  ”I had the benefit of getting up everyday for six or so months believing that Mitt Romney would become president of the United States,” Leavitt said. ”By the time we got to election night, not only did we, but other people, believed he would be  . The next morning, it was remarkable disappointment. It was hard every day for weeks not to think, ’Today is day 17, we would have done X, Y and Z.’ We literally had a   schedule based on what needed to be done.”  Disappointment was also the description from Ryan Cunningham, executive director for John Kerry’s transition in 2004, when Kerry lost to Bush.  ”It’s extremely disappointing,” Cunningham said. ”We had done all of the work, we had our notebooks ready to go, the offices were ready for   Kerry, and we were in Boston on election night. We were in the hotel where   Kerry would have gone to make his acceptance speech and we were literally ready to sit down with him and open the notebook to page one and say, ’Mr.   let’s begin. ’” Cunningham said all the work was then boxed up and the team would four years later support Obama’s transition. Leavitt turned his work into a book, ”Romney Readiness Project 2012,” which offers a road map for transition planning.  But even though both remember the sadness of election night, neither feels regret for the work they put in along the way.  ”Every four years someone lives the experience I did,” Leavitt said. ”That’s a difficult part of a democracy, but one that we all ought to be grateful for.”"
294,"How Police Found Second Bomb, and a ‘Total Containment Vessel’ Hauled It Away - The New York Times",2016-09-21,"After the explosion on West 23rd Street on Saturday night, the police did what they typically do when they suspect a bomb has gone off. They spread out and began looking for unexploded bombs  —   what those on the New York Police Department’s bomb squad call “secondaries. ” Officers began searching block by block, going as far south as 14th Street and as far north as 34th Street. A few hours into the effort, two state troopers participating in the search found what appeared to be one, on West 27th Street, about four blocks above the explosion. On the sidewalk on the north side of the street, there was a pressure cooker with a cellphone attached to it, law enforcement officials said. A photograph of the device shared on social media shows the cookware, with wires and the cellphone. The authorities confirmed that the photo was authentic. The police have not said whether a tip helped lead the troopers to the device or whether the officers discovered it entirely unaided. “They circled the block and they parked their vehicle and actually walked down the block, and that’s how they found it,” the city’s new police commissioner, James P. O’Neill, said at a news conference on Sunday. “They did a great job. ” The police used a robot to inspect the device and place it in what is called a “total containment vessel,” a spherical chamber hitched to a police truck. The vehicle set off east on West 27th Street around 2:25 a. m. turning north on Avenue of the Americas and then heading toward the Bronx. The total containment vessel is essentially an   diving vessel, Lt. Mark Torre, the commanding officer of the department’s bomb squad, said in an interview in July. “Instead of keeping the pressure out and keeping you alive in five fathoms of water, it keeps the pressure in,” he explained. Should a bomb explode inside, tiny vents allow pressure to escape. “It sounds like a hammer hitting a piece of steel,” he said. It was not clear how many such vessels the department has, but it appears to be at least three. In 2014, the department put out an advertisement in search of a company that “feels it can provide services necessary to refurbish three existing total containment vessels,” according to contracting records. Such vessels are often capable of containing a blast of 25 pounds of TNT or more, and they are increasingly a common piece of equipment for police agencies across the country. Even the campus force for the University of Georgia has one. Because the purpose of the vessel is to contain the blast, the bomb squad does not typically close streets when it drives through the city with a bomb in the containment vessel. The police brought the device to Rodman’s Neck, a peninsula in the Bronx where the police have a facility. It is where many suspicious packages and much unexploded ordnance ends up, for the bomb squad to disassemble or blow up in a controlled environment. The police have said little about what the bomb squad has learned about the device found on West 27th Street. It appeared to resemble in some ways the devices used in the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings. The Boston Marathon bombers, the brothers Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, appeared to have gotten their plans for the two   bombs they placed at the finishing line from Inspire, the   magazine published online by Al Qaeda’s branch in Yemen. Each issue includes    instructions on building bombs and mounting attacks. By Sunday afternoon, the bomb squad was struggling to find a way to open the device that minimized the risk of an explosion, a law enforcement official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the continuing investigation. Much about the device remained unknown. But if it was similar to the one that exploded on West 23rd Street, it was powerful. That explosion sent a Dumpster well over 100 feet down the street, the official said. On Sunday, after the police used a small controlled explosion to disable the device, it was being sent to the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s laboratory in Quantico, Va."

Jeff Jeans of Sedona, Arizona, told Ryan, who is leading the fight in the House to repeal Obamacare, that he had been a small business owner and ”lifelong Republican” before being diagnosed with cancer, with just six weeks to live, at age 49.  ”I want to thank President Obama from the bottom of my heart because I would be dead if it weren’t for him,” Jeans told Ryan on Thursday night, receiving applause from the audience.

The attack took place around 12:30 p. m. in Philadelphia’s Kensington neighborhood on the 3500 block of B Street. “It hits really hard when you see something with that level of brutality, and what appears to be that random looking, and again in broad daylight conditions. It does get a little startling,” police Captain Sekou Kinebrew told WPVI. The three suspected attackers can be seen peering into storefront windows before the assault, when one of the men wearing a cast on his right arm appears to signal to the other two men as he’s looking into one of the windows. The other two males turn around, as the victim exits the restaurant. The victim told WTXF that he was stopping by the restaurant to pick up a job application. Suddenly, the three attackers knock him to the ground, beating him and stomping on him until he became unconscious. Meanwhile, one of the attackers went through his pocket and stole his money, wallet, and cell phone. Police say they are unsure of whether the victim knew his attackers.

299,Mobile Bay boaters missing after storm,2015-04-26," (CNN) Two bodies have been recovered from Mobile Bay, Alabama, after a severe storm capsized sailboats in a regatta on Saturday, U. S. Coast Guard Capt. Duke Walker said Sunday. Walker said authorities are still looking for five missing people. Maj. Steve Thompson with the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency called the effort ”a recovery operation.” Walker said two aircraft and numerous boats searched on Sunday. Searchers have covered more than 2, 500 miles, he said. More than 100 sailboats took part in the Dauphin Island Race on Saturday afternoon and 40 people were rescued from the water, the Coast Guard said. ”Our guys worked hard and long to rescue people,” Walker said. ”This is an awful tragedy and our hearts go out to the families.”  One body was found Saturday night and another Sunday morning, he said. Walker says they believe at least one person was not from the regatta, but was a mariner on the water at the time.  Jeff Carter, deputy director of Mobile County Emergency Management, said besides overturned sailboats, one vessel hit a bridge. Coast Guard Sector Mobile received a report at approximately 4:30 p. m. Saturday that a sailing regatta in Mobile Bay had been struck by severe weather, causing several vessels to capsize and leaving a number of people in the water. The Fairhope Yacht Club sponsors the Dauphin Island Race, according to the club website. The club says this is the 57th year for the event."

My father is an incredibly hard worker and he will be working for each and every one of you and together, we will make America great again. ”’ ’Retaking the mic, Trump then took a second to call out political pundits who said that, once other candidates dropped out, Trump would likely be able to be taken out.’ ’”A number of the pundits said, ’’Well, if a couple of the other candidates drop out, if you add their scores together it’’s going to equal Trump,’’” he said. ”They’’re geniuses. They don’’t understand that as people drop out, I’’m going to get a lot of those votes also, so you don’’t just add them together. ”’ ’He then congratulated Cruz and Rubio for doing ”quite well” in the state.’ ’’ ”Trump’s win is  as he just joined a very exclusive group of candidates.” ’Only three Republican candidates prior ro Trump have won both the New Hampshire and South Carolina primaries in contested years. Those three, Ronald Reagan in 1980, George H. W. Bush in 1988 and 1992, and John McCain in 2008, went on to win the nomination. ’ ’In addition, just one South Carolina primary winner has not been the Republican nominee  —   former House Speaker Newt Gingrich. Gingrich won in 2012, but lost the nomination to former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney.’ ’Most polls had given Trump a big edge heading into the primary. He held a   lead over Rubio and Cruz, per the RealClearPolitics  there.’ ’The South Carolina victory followed an easy win for Trump in New Hampshire and a   showing in Iowa. The Republican caucuses in Nevada will weigh in on the GOP primary on Tuesday.’ ’Trump also tweeted that he would have been happy with a   victory:’ ’’ ’ ’t’t’tPeople (pundits) gave me no chance in South Carolina. Now it looks like a possible win. I would be happy with a one vote victory! (HOPE)’t’t’ ’’ ’ ’t’t’tWhat a great night. Thank you South Carolina, a special place with truly amazing people! LOVE’t’t’ ’Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. ..’"
301,Blue State Blues: The Debates Were Shamefully Silent on Benghazi,2016-10-20,"The word “Benghazi” was never mentioned in the first presidential debate. It was only mentioned once in the second debate. And it was ignored again in the third debate. (The vice presidential debate ignored it, too. )[That sole mention of Benghazi occurred when Donald Trump brought it up in his own defense, in response to a question about why he had tweeted at three o’clock in the morning. about a dispute with a former Miss Universe.  Yes, the debates were that trivial. Here, for the record, is the only mention of Benghazi: COOPER: Mr. Trump, let me follow up with you. In 2008, you wrote in one of your books that the most important characteristic of a good leader is discipline. You said, if a leader doesn’t have it, quote, “he or she won’t be one for very long. ” In the days after the first debate, you sent out a series of tweets from 3 a. m. to 5 a. m. including one that told people to check out a sex tape. Is that the discipline of a good leader? TRUMP: No, there wasn’t check out a sex tape. It was just take a look at the person that she built up to be this wonderful Girl Scout who was no Girl Scout. COOPER: You mentioned sex tape. TRUMP: By the way, just so you understand, when she said 3 o’clock in the morning, take a look at Benghazi. She said who is going to answer the call at 3 o’clock in the morning? Guess what? She didn’t answer it, because when Ambassador Stevens  …     COOPER: The question is, is that the discipline of a good leader? TRUMP:   …     600  —   wait a minute, Anderson, 600 times. Well, she said she was awake at 3 o’clock in the morning, and she also sent a tweet out at 3 o’clock in the morning, but I won’t even mention that. But she said she’ll be awake. Who’s going  —   the famous thing, we’re going to answer our call at 3 o’clock in the morning. Guess what happened? Ambassador Stevens  —   Ambassador Stevens sent 600 requests for help. And the only one she talked to was Sidney Blumenthal, who’s her friend and not a good guy, by the way. So, you know, she shouldn’t be talking about that. We never had “what happened at Benghazi?”  —   but we did have “did you tell people to check out a sex tape at 3 a. m.?”. Trump deserves some criticism for neglecting Benghazi, which he should have brought up in every debate. But the real blame rests with the moderators. Even Fox News’ Chris Wallace, who earned praise by conducting the only fair debate of the three, failed to mention Benghazi. Patricia Smith, mother of the late Benghazi hero Sean Smith, told me before the third debate that she hoped to hear about what happened on Sep. 11, 2012  —   and told me afterwards how disgusted she was that it was ignored. A simple, straightforward question would have sufficed. “Secretary Clinton, the Benghazi terror attack happened while you were Secretary of State. Should the voters consider that a test of your ability to perform as   ?” For balance, he could have asked Trump a tough  . “Mr. Trump, you have criticized Secretary Clinton on Benghazi. But she has been in the Situation Room, and you have no experience in national security. Are you, sir, ready to be   ?” But the only time we heard anything about “  ” was in the first debate, when Clinton invoked the phrase  —   to argue that Trump was unfit to serve in that role. No one  —   neither the moderators, nor the candidates  —   mentioned it again. It might be argued that Benghazi was an issue for 2012, not 2016 that the person in charge that night was Barack Obama, not Hillary Clinton that after years of investigation there was no “smoking gun”  —   “no scandal at all,” the Washington Post said. All of that could be true, and the omission of Benghazi would still be a disgrace, not only because so many of the other issues raised were so meaningless, but fundamentally because we still do not know why Americans in danger were left to die alone. What about the future? Will the next president seek the whole truth? What steps will the next president take to ensure that never happens again? How will the men who died  —   and saved dozens of others, thanklessly  —   be honored for their sacrifice? We have some idea  —   from portions of Trump’s speeches  —   but voters deserved to hear answers in the debates. History will not care whether Miss Universe once had sex on television. History will judge our neglect of the dead, and the carelessness with which we treat our future security. Joel B. Pollak is Senior    at Breitbart News.

302,Donald Trump’s New York Times Interview: Full Transcript - The New York Times,2016-12-01,"Following is a transcript of   Donald J. Trump’s interview on Tuesday with reporters, editors and opinion columnists from The New York Times. The transcription was prepared by Liam Stack, Jonah Engel Bromwich, Karen Workman and Tim Herrera of The Times. More on the Trump transition here. ARTHUR SULZBERGER Jr. publisher of The New York Times: Thank you very much for joining us. And I want to reaffirm this is on the record. DONALD J. TRUMP,   of the United States: O. K. SULZBERGER: All right, so we’re clear. We had a very nice meeting in the Churchill Room. You’re a Churchill fan, I hear? TRUMP: I am, I am. SULZBERGER: There’s a photo of the great man behind you. TRUMP: There was a big thing about the bust that was removed out of the Oval Office. SULZBERGER: I heard you’re thinking of putting it back. TRUMP: I am, indeed. I am. SULZBERGER: Wonderful. So we’ve got a good collection here from our newsroom and editorial and our columnists. I just want to say we had a good, quiet, but useful and   conversation in there. So I appreciate that very much. TRUMP: I appreciate it, too. SULZBERGER: I thought maybe I’d start this off by asking if you have anything you would like to start this off with before we move to the easiest questions you’re going to get this administration. [laughter] TRUMP: O. K. Well, I just appreciate the meeting and I have great respect for The New York Times. Tremendous respect. It’s very special. Always has been very special. I think I’ve been treated very rough. It’s well out there that I’ve been treated extremely unfairly in a sense, in a true sense. I wouldn’t only complain about The Times. I would say The Times was about the roughest of all. You could make the case The Washington Post was bad, but every once in a while I’d actually get a good article. Not often, Dean, but every once in awhile. Look, I have great respect for The Times, and I’d like to turn it around. I think it would make the job I am doing much easier. We’re working very hard. We have great people coming in. I think you’ll be very impressed with the names. We’ll be announcing some very shortly. Everybody wanted to do this. People are giving up tremendous careers in order to be subject to you folks and subject to a lot of other folks. But they’re giving up a lot. I mean some are giving up tremendous businesses in order to sit for four or maybe eight or whatever the period of time is. But I think we’re going to see some tremendous talent, tremendous talent coming in. We have many people for every job. I mean no matter what the job is, we have many incredible people. I think, Reince, you can sort of just confirm that. The quality of the people is very good. REINCE PRIEBUS, Mr. Trump’s choice for chief of staff: [inaudible] TRUMP: We’re trying very hard to get the best people. Not necessarily people that will be the most politically correct people, because that hasn’t been working. So we have really experts in the field. Some are known and some are not known, but they’re known within their field as being the best. That’s very important to me. You know, I’ve been given a great honor. It’s been very tough. It’s been 18 months of brutality in a true sense, but we won it. We won it pretty big. The final numbers are coming out. Or I guess they’re coming out. Michigan’s just being confirmed. But the numbers are coming out far beyond what anybody’s wildest expectation was. I don’t know if it was us, I mean, we were seeing the kind of crowds and kind of, everything, the kind of enthusiasm we were getting from the people. As you probably know, I did many, many speeches that last   period. I was just telling Arthur that I went around and did speeches in the pretty much 11 different places, that were, the massive crowds we were getting. If we had a stadium that held  —   and most of you, many of you were there  —   that held 20, 000 people, we’d have 15, 000 people outside that couldn’t get in. So we came up with a good system  —   we put up the big screens outside with a very good loudspeaker system and very few people left. I would do, during the last month, two or three a day. That’s a lot. Because that’s not easy when you have big crowds. Those speeches, that’s not an easy way of life, doing three a day. Then I said the last two days, I want to do six and seven. And I’m not sure anybody has ever done that. But we did six and we did seven and the last one ended at 1 o’clock in the morning in Michigan. And we had 31, 000 people, 17, 000 or 18, 000 inside and the rest outside. This massive place in Grand Rapids, I guess. And it was an incredible thing. And I left saying: ‘How do we lose Michigan? I don’t think we can lose Michigan.’ And the reason I did that, it was set up only a little while before  —   because we heard that day that Hillary was hearing that they’re going to lose Michigan, which hasn’t been lost in 38 years. Or something. But 38 years. And they didn’t want to lose Michigan. So they went out along with President Obama and Michelle, Bill and Hillary, they went to Michigan late that, sort of late afternoon and I said, ‘Let’s go to Michigan.’ It wasn’t on the schedule. So I finished up in New Hampshire and at 10 o’clock I went to Michigan. We got there at 12 o’clock. We started speaking around 12:45, actually, and we had 31, 000 people and I said, really, I mean, there are things happening. But we saw it everywhere. So we felt very good. we had great numbers. And we thought we’re going to win. We thought we were going to win Florida. We thought we were going to win North Carolina. We did easily, pretty easily. We thought strongly we were going to win Pennsylvania. The problem is nobody had won it and it was known, as you know, the great state that always got away. Every Republican thought they were going to win Pennsylvania for 38 years and they just couldn’t win it. And I thought we were going to win it. And we won it, we won it, you know, relatively easily, we won it by a number of points. Florida we won by 180, 000  —   was that the number, 180? PRIEBUS: [inaudible] TRUMP: More than 180, 000 voted, and votes are still coming in from the military, which we are getting about 85 percent of. So we won that by a lot of votes and, you know, we had a great victory. We had a great victory. I think it would have been easier because I see every once in awhile somebody says, ‘Well, the popular vote.’ Well, the popular vote would have been a lot easier, but it’s a whole different campaign. I would have been in California, I would have been in Texas, Florida and New York, and we wouldn’t have gone anywhere else. Which is, I mean I’d rather do the popular vote from the standpoint  —   I’d think we’d do actually as well or better  —   it’s a whole different campaign. It’s like, if you’re a golfer, it’s like match play versus stroke play. It’s a whole different game. But I think the popular vote would have been easier in a true sense because you’d go to a few places. I think that’s the genius of the Electoral College. I was never a fan of the Electoral College until now. SULZBERGER: Until now. [laughter] TRUMP: Until now. I guess now I like it for two reasons. What it does do is it gets you out to see states that you’ll never see otherwise. It’s very interesting. Like Maine. I went to Maine four times. I went to Maine 2 for one, because everybody was saying you can get to 269 but there is no path to 270. We learned that was false because we ended up with what,  . PRIEBUS: I’ve got to get, we’ve got to get Michigan in. TRUMP: But there is no path to 270, you have to get the one in Maine, so we kept going back to Maine and we did get the one in Maine. We kept going to Maine 2, and we went to a lot of states that you wouldn’t spend a lot of time in and it does get you  —   we actually went to about 22 states, whereas if you’re going for popular vote, you’d probably go to four, or three, it could be three. You wouldn’t leave New York. You’d stay in New York and you’d stay in California. So there’s a certain genius about it. And I like it either way. But it’s sort of interesting. But we had an amazing period of time. I got to know the country, we have a great country, we’re a great, great people, and the enthusiasm was really incredible. The Los Angeles Times had a poll which was interesting because I was always up in that poll. They had something that is, I guess, a   technique in polling, it was called enthusiasm. They added an enthusiasm factor and my people had great enthusiasm, and Hillary’s people didn’t have enthusiasm. And in the end she didn’t get the   vote and we ended up close to 15 points, as you know. We started off at one, we ended up with almost 15. And more importantly, a lot of people didn’t show up, because the   community liked me. They liked what I was saying. So they didn’t necessarily vote for me, but they didn’t show up, which was a big problem that she had. I ended up doing very well with women, which was  —   which I never understood why I was doing poorly, because we’d go to the rallies and we’d have so many women holding up signs, “Women for Trump. ” But I kept reading polls saying that I’m not doing well with women. I think whoever is doing it here would say that we did very well with women, especially certain women. DEAN BAQUET, executive editor of The New York Times: As you describe it, you did do something really remarkable. You energized a lot of people in the country who really wanted change in Washington. But along with that  —   and this is going to create a tricky thing for you  —   you also energized presumably a smaller number of people who were evidenced at the   convention in Washington this weekend. Who have a very   …     TRUMP: I just saw that today. BAQUET: So, I’d love to hear you talk about how you’re going to manage that group of people who actually may not be the larger group but who have an expectation for you and are angry about the country and its  —   along racial lines. My first question is, do you feel like you said things that energized them in particular, and how are you going to manage that? TRUMP: I don’t think so, Dean. First of all, I don’t want to energize the group. I’m not looking to energize them. I don’t want to energize the group, and I disavow the group. They, again, I don’t know if it’s reporting or whatever. I don’t know where they were four years ago, and where they were for Romney and McCain and all of the other people that ran, so I just don’t know, I had nothing to compare it to. But it’s not a group I want to energize, and if they are energized I want to look into it and find out why. What we do want to do is we want to bring the country together, because the country is very, very divided, and that’s one thing I did see, big league. It’s very, very divided, and I’m going to work very hard to bring the country together. I mean, I’m somebody that really has gotten along with people over the years. It was interesting, my wife, I went to a big event about two years ago. Just after I started thinking about politics. And we’re walking in and some people were cheering and some people were booing, and she said, you know, ‘People have never booed for you.’ I’ve never had a person boo me, and all of a sudden people are booing me. She said, that’s never happened before. And, it’s politics. You know, all of a sudden they think I’m going to be running for office, and I’m a Republican, let’s say. So it’s something that I had never experienced before and I said, ‘Those people are booing,’ and she said, ‘Yup.’ They’d never booed before. But now they boo. You know, it was a group and another group was going the opposite. No, I want to bring the country together. It’s very important to me. We’re in a very divided country. In many ways divided. BAQUET: So I’m going to do that thing that executive editors get to do which is to invite reporters to jump in and ask questions. MAGGIE HABERMAN, political reporter: I’ll start, thank you, Dean. Mr. President, I’d like to thank you for being here. This morning, Kellyanne Conway talked about not prosecuting Hillary Clinton. We were hoping you could talk about exactly what that means  —   does that mean just the emails, or the emails and the foundation, and how you came to that decision. TRUMP: Well, there was a report that somebody said that I’m not enthused about it. Look, I want to move forward, I don’t want to move back. And I don’t want to hurt the Clintons. I really don’t. She went through a lot. And suffered greatly in many different ways. And I am not looking to hurt them at all. The campaign was vicious. They say it was the most vicious primary and the most vicious campaign. I guess, added together, it was definitely the most vicious probably, I assume you sold a lot of newspapers. [laughter] I would imagine. I would imagine. I’m just telling you, Maggie, I’m not looking to hurt them. I think they’ve been through a lot. They’ve gone through a lot. I’m really looking   …     I think we have to get the focus of the country into looking forward. SULZBERGER: If I could interject, we had a good conversation there, you and I, and it was off the record, but there was nothing secret, just wanted to make sure. The idea of looking forward was one of the themes that you were saying. That we need to now get past the election, right? MATTHEW PURDY, deputy managing editor: So you’re definitively taking that off the table? The investigation? TRUMP: No, but the question was asked. PURDY: About the emails and the foundation? TRUMP: No, no, but it’s just not something that I feel very strongly about. I feel very strongly about health care. I feel very strongly about an immigration bill that I think even the people in this room can be happy. You know, you’ve been talking about immigration bills for 50 years and nothing’s ever happened. I feel very strongly about an immigration bill that’s fair and just and a lot of other things. There are a lot of things I feel strongly about. I’m not looking to look back and go through this. This was a very painful period. This was a very painful election with all of the email things and all of the foundation things and all of the everything that they went through and the whole country went through. This was a very painful period of time. I read recently where it was, it was, they’re saying, they used to say it was Lincoln against whoever and none of us were there to see it. And there aren’t a lot of recordings of that, right? [laughter] But the fact is that there were some pretty vicious elections they say this was, this was the most. They say it was definitely the most vicious primary. And I think it’s very important to look forward. CAROLYN RYAN, senior editor for politics: Do you think it would disappoint your supporters who seemed very animated by the idea of accountability in the Clintons? What would you say to them? TRUMP: I don’t think they will be disappointed. I think I will explain it, that we have to, in many ways save our country. Because our country’s really in bad, big trouble. We have a lot of trouble. A lot of problems. And one of the big problems, I talk about, divisiveness. I think that a lot of people will appreciate   …     I’m not doing it for that reason. I’m doing it because it’s time to go in a different direction. There was a lot of pain, and I think that the people that supported me with such enthusiasm, where they will show up at 1 in the morning to hear a speech. It was actually Election Day, they showed up at, so that was essentially Election Day. Yeah, I think they’d understand very completely. THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, opinion columnist: Mr.   can I ask a question? One of the issues that you actually were very careful not to speak about during the campaign, and haven’t spoken about yet, is one very near and dear to my heart, the whole issue of climate change, the Paris agreement, how you’ll approach it. You own some of the most beautiful links golf courses in the world   …     [laughter, cross talk] TRUMP: [laughing] I read your article. Some will be even better because actually like Doral is a little bit off   …     so it’ll be perfect. [inaudible] He doesn’t say that. He just says that the ones that are near the water will be gone, but Doral will be in great shape. [laughter] FRIEDMAN: But it’s really important to me, and I think to a lot of our readers, to know where you’re going to go with this. I don’t think anyone objects to, you know, doing all forms of energy. But are you going to take America out of the world’s lead of confronting climate change? TRUMP: I’m looking at it very closely, Tom. I’ll tell you what. I have an open mind to it. We’re going to look very carefully. It’s one issue that’s interesting because there are few things where there’s more division than climate change. You don’t tend to hear this, but there are people on the other side of that issue who are, think, don’t even   …     SULZBERGER: We do hear it. FRIEDMAN: I was on ‘Squawk Box’ with Joe Kernen this morning, so I got an earful of it. [laughter] TRUMP: Joe is one of them. But a lot of smart people disagree with you. I have a very open mind. And I’m going to study a lot of the things that happened on it and we’re going to look at it very carefully. But I have an open mind. SULZBERGER: Well, since we’re living on an island, sir, I want to thank you for having an open mind. We saw what these storms are now doing, right? We’ve seen it personally. Straight up. FRIEDMAN: But you have an open mind on this? TRUMP: I do have an open mind. And we’ve had storms always, Arthur. SULZBERGER: Not like this. TRUMP: You know the hottest day ever was in   98. You know, you can make lots of cases for different views. I have a totally open mind. My uncle was for 35 years a professor at M. I. T. He was a great engineer, scientist. He was a great guy. And he was   …     a long time ago, he had feelings  —   this was a long time ago  —   he had feelings on this subject. It’s a very complex subject. I’m not sure anybody is ever going to really know. I know we have, they say they have science on one side but then they also have those horrible emails that were sent between the scientists. Where was that, in Geneva or wherever five years ago? Terrible. Where they got caught, you know, so you see that and you say, what’s this all about. I absolutely have an open mind. I will tell you this: Clean air is vitally important. Clean water, crystal clean water is vitally important. Safety is vitally important. And you know, you mentioned a lot of the courses. I have some great, great, very successful golf courses. I’ve received so many environmental awards for the way I’ve done, you know. I’ve done a tremendous amount of work where I’ve received tremendous numbers. Sometimes I’ll say I’m actually an environmentalist and people will smile in some cases and other people that know me understand that’s true. Open mind. JAMES BENNET, editorial page editor: When you say an open mind, you mean you’re just not sure whether human activity causes climate change? Do you think human activity is or isn’t connected? TRUMP: I think right now   …     well, I think there is some connectivity. There is some, something. It depends on how much. It also depends on how much it’s going to cost our companies. You have to understand, our companies are noncompetitive right now. They’re really largely noncompetitive. About four weeks ago, I started adding a certain little sentence into a lot of my speeches, that we’ve lost 70, 000 factories since W. Bush. 70, 000. When I first looked at the number, I said: ‘That must be a typo. It can’t be 70, you can’t have 70, 000, you wouldn’t think you have 70, 000 factories here.’ And it wasn’t a typo, it’s right. We’ve lost 70, 000 factories. We’re not a competitive nation with other nations anymore. We have to make ourselves competitive. We’re not competitive for a lot of reasons. That’s becoming more and more of the reason. Because a lot of these countries that we do business with, they make deals with our president, or whoever, and then they don’t adhere to the deals, you know that. And it’s much less expensive for their companies to produce products. So I’m going to be studying that very hard, and I think I have a very big voice in it. And I think my voice is listened to, especially by people that don’t believe in it. And we’ll let you know. FRIEDMAN: I’d hate to see Royal Aberdeen underwater. TRUMP: The North Sea, that could be, that’s a good one, right? ELISABETH BUMILLER, Washington bureau chief: I just wanted to follow up on the question you were asked about not pursuing any investigations into Hillary Clinton. Did you mean both the email investigation and the foundation investigation  —   you will not pursue either one of those? TRUMP: Yeah, look, you know we’ll have people that do things but my inclination would be, for whatever power I have on the matter, is to say let’s go forward. This has been looked at for so long. Ad nauseam. Let’s go forward. And you know, you could also make the case that some good work was done in the foundation and they could have made mistakes, etc. etc. I think it’s time, I think it’s time for people to say let’s go and solve some of the problems that we have, which are massive problems and, you know, I do think that they’ve gone through a lot. I think losing is going through a lot. It was a tough, it was a very tough evening for her. I think losing is going through a lot. So, for whatever it’s worth, my, my attitude is strongly we have to go forward, we have so many different problems to solve, I don’t think we have to delve back in the past. I also think that would be a very divisive, well I think it would be very divisive, you know I’m talking about bringing together, and then they go into all sorts of stuff, I think it would be very, very divisive for the country. SULZBERGER: I agree, I think speaking not as a journalist now, it’s very healthy. There, and then we’re going to go MICHAEL D. SHEAR, White House correspondent: Mr. Trump, Mike Shear. I cover the White House, covering your administration   …     TRUMP: See ya there. [laughter] SHEAR: Just one quick clarification on the climate change, do you intend to, as you said, pull out of the Paris Climate   …     TRUMP: I’m going to take a look at it. SHEAR [interrupts]: And if the reaction from foreign leaders is to slap tariffs on American goods to offset the carbon that the United States had pledged to reduce, is that O. K. with you? And then the second question is on your sort of mixing of your global business interests and the presidency. There’s already, even just in the 10, two weeks you’ve been   instances where you’ve met with your Indian business partners   …     TRUMP: Sure. SHEAR: You’ve talked about the impact of the wind farms on your golf course. People, experts who are lawyers and ethics experts, say that all of that is totally inappropriate, so I guess the question for you is, what do you see as the appropriate structure for keeping those two things separate, and are there any lines that you think you won’t want to cross once you’re in the White House? TRUMP: O. K. First of all, on countries. I think that countries will not do that to us. I don’t think if they’re run by a person that understands leadership and negotiation they’re in no position to do that to us, no matter what I do. They’re in no position to do that to us, and that won’t happen, but I’m going to take a look at it. A very serious look. I want to also see how much this is costing, you know, what’s the cost to it, and I’ll be talking to you folks in the    future about it, having to do with what just took place. As far as the, you know, potential conflict of interests, though, I mean I know that from the standpoint, the law is totally on my side, meaning, the president can’t have a conflict of interest. That’s been reported very widely. Despite that, I don’t want there to be a conflict of interest anyway. And the laws, the president can’t. And I understand why the president can’t have a conflict of interest now because everything a president does in some ways is like a conflict of interest, but I have, I’ve built a very great company and it’s a big company and it’s all over the world. People are starting to see, when they look at all these different jobs, like in India and other things, number one, a job like that builds great relationships with the people of India, so it’s all good. But I have to say, the partners come in, they’re very, very successful people. They come in, they’d say, they said, ‘Would it be possible to have a picture?’ Actually, my children are working on that job. So I can say to them, Arthur, ‘I don’t want to have a picture,’ or, I can take a picture. I mean, I think it’s wonderful to take a picture. I’m fine with a picture. But if it were up to some people, I would never, ever see my daughter Ivanka again. That would be like you never seeing your son again. That wouldn’t be good. That wouldn’t be good. But I’d never, ever see my daughter Ivanka. UNKNOWN: That means you’d have to make Ivanka deputy President, you know. TRUMP: I know, I know, yeah. [room laughs] Well, I couldn’t do that either. I can’t, that can’t work. I can’t do anything, I would never see my, I guess the only son I’d be allowed to see, at least for a little while, would be Barron, because he’s 10. But, but, so there has to be [unintelligible]. It’s a very interesting case. UNKNOWN: You could sell your company though, right? With all due respect, you could sell your company and then   …     TRUMP: Well   …     UNKNOWN: And then you could see them all the time. TRUMP: That’s a very hard thing to do, you know what, because I have real estate. I have real estate all over the world, which now people are understanding. When I filed my forms with the federal election, people said, ‘Wow that’s really a big company, that’s a big company.’ It really is big, it’s diverse, it’s all over the world. It’s a great company with great assets. I think that, you know, selling real estate isn’t like selling stock. Selling real estate is much different, it’s in a much different world. I’d say this, and I mean this and I said it on “60 Minutes” the other night: My company is so unimportant to me relative to what I’m doing, ’cause I don’t need money, I don’t need anything, and by the way, I’m very   I have a very small percentage of my money in debt, very very small percentage of my money in debt, in fact, banks have said ‘We’d like to loan you money, we’d like to give you any amount of money.’ I’ve been there before, I’ve had it both ways, I’ve been   I’ve been   and, especially as you get older,   is much better. UNKNOWN: Mr.     …     TRUMP: Just a minute, because it’s an important question. I don’t care about my company. I mean, if a partner comes in from India or if a partner comes in from Canada, where we did a beautiful big building that just opened, and they want to take a picture and come into my office, and my kids come in and, I originally made the deal with these people, I mean what am I going to say? I’m not going to talk to you, I’m not going to take pictures? You have to, you know, on a human basis, you take pictures. But I just want to say that I am given the right to do something so important in terms of so many of the issues we discussed, in terms of health care, in terms of so many different things. I don’t care about my company. It doesn’t matter. My kids run it. They’ll say I have a conflict because we just opened a beautiful hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue, so every time somebody stays at that hotel, if they stay because I’m president, I guess you could say it’s a conflict of interest. It’s a conflict of interest, but again, I’m not going to have anything to do with the hotel, and they may very well. I mean it could be that occupancy at that hotel will be because, psychologically, occupancy at that hotel will be probably a more valuable asset now than it was before, O. K.? The brand is certainly a hotter brand than it was before. I can’t help that, but I don’t care. I said on “60 Minutes”: I don’t care. Because it doesn’t matter. The only thing that matters to me is running our country. MICHAEL BARBARO, political reporter: Mr.   can I press you a little further on what structures you would put in place to keep the presidency and the company separate and to avoid things that, for example, were reported in The Times in the past 24 hours about meeting with leaders of Brexit about wind farms   …     TRUMP: About meeting with who? BARBARO: Leaders of Brexit about wind farms that might interfere with the views of your golf course and how to keep, what structures, can you talk about that meeting, by the way? TRUMP: Was I involved with the wind farms recently? Or, not that I know of. I mean, I have a problem with wind   …     BARBARO: But you brought it up in the meeting, didn’t you? TRUMP: Which meeting? I don’t know. I might have. BARBARO: With leaders of Brexit. MANY VOICES: With Farage. TRUMP: Oh, I see. I might have brought it up. But not having to do with me, just I mean, the wind is a very deceiving thing. First of all, we don’t make the windmills in the United States. They’re made in Germany and Japan. They’re made out of massive amounts of steel, which goes into the atmosphere, whether it’s in our country or not, it goes into the atmosphere. The windmills kill birds and the windmills need massive subsidies. In other words, we’re subsidizing wind mills all over this country. I mean, for the most part they don’t work. I don’t think they work at all without subsidy, and that bothers me, and they kill all the birds. You go to a windmill, you know in California they have the, what is it? The golden eagle? And they’re like, if you shoot a golden eagle, they go to jail for five years and yet they kill them by, they actually have to get permits that they’re only allowed to kill 30 or something in one year. The windmills are devastating to the bird population, O. K. With that being said, there’s a place for them. But they do need subsidy. So, if I talk negatively. I’ve been saying the same thing for years about you know, the wind industry. I wouldn’t want to subsidize it. Some environmentalists agree with me very much because of all of the things I just said, including the birds, and some don’t. But it’s hard to explain. I don’t care about anything having to do with anything having to do with anything other than the country. BARBARO: But the structures, just to be clear, that’s the question. How do you formalize the separation of these things so that there is not a question of whether or not you as president   …     TRUMP: O. K. BARBARO:   …     are trying to influence something, like wind farms? TRUMP: O. K. I don’t want to influence anything, because it’s not that, it’s not that important to me. It’s hard to explain. BARBARO: Yes, but the structures? TRUMP: Now, according to the law, see I figured there’s something where you put something in this massive trust and there’s also  —   nothing is written. In other words, in theory, I can be president of the United States and run my business 100 percent, sign checks on my business, which I am phasing out of very rapidly, you know, I sign checks, I’m the   type. I like to sign checks so I know what is going on as opposed to pressing a computer button, boom, and thousands of checks are automatically sent. It keeps, it tells me what’s going on a little bit and it tells contractors that I’m watching. But I am phasing that out now, and handing that to Eric Trump and Don Trump and Ivanka Trump for the most part, and some of my executives, so that’s happening right now. But in theory I could run my business perfectly, and then run the country perfectly. And there’s never been a case like this where somebody’s had, like, if you look at other people of wealth, they didn’t have this kind of asset and this kind of wealth, frankly. It’s just a different thing. But there is no  —   I assumed that you’d have to set up some type of trust or whatever and you know. And I was actually a little bit surprised to see it. So in theory I don’t have to do anything. But I would like to do something. I would like to try and formalize something, because I don’t care about my business. Doral is going to run very nice. We own this incredible place in Miami. We own many incredible places, including Turnberry, I guess you heard. There’s one guy that does  —   when I say Turnberry, you know what that is, right. Do a little [inaudible]. But they’re going to run well, we have good managers, they’re going to run really well. So I don’t have to do anything, but I want to do something if I can. If there is something. BARBARO: Can you promise us when you decide exactly what that is, you’ll come tell The New York Times about it? [laughter] TRUMP: I will. I’ve started it already. SULZBERGER: One of our great salesmen, by the way. TRUMP: I can see that. I’ve started it already by, I mean, I’ve greatly reduced the   and the business. I’ve greatly reduced meetings with contractors, meetings with different people that, you know, I’ve also started by  —   ’cause I’ve said over the last two years, once I decided I wanted to run, I don’t want to build anything. ’Cause building, like for instance, we built the post office, you’ll be happy to hear, ahead of schedule and under budget. Substantially ahead of schedule. Almost two years ago of schedule. But ahead of schedule, under budget, and it’s a terrific place. That’s the hotel on Pennsylvania. FRIEDMAN: Just so you know, General Electric has a big wind turbine factory in South Carolina. Just so you know. TRUMP: Well that’s good. But most of ‘em are made in Germany, most of ‘em are made, you know, Siemens and the Chinese are making most of them. [cross talk] TRUMP: They may assemble  —   if you check, I think you’ll find that the, it’s delivered there and they do most of the assembly. JULIE HIRSCHFELD DAVIS, White House correspondent: Mr.    —   I’m sorry I entered late, but I did want to ask you about   …     BAQUET: You should introduce yourself. DAVIS: I’m Julie Davis, one of the White House correspondents. TRUMP: Hi, Julie. DAVIS: I apologize for my delayed flight. I wanted to ask you about personnel. They say personnel is policy. TRUMP: I can’t quite hear. DAVIS: Personnel. TRUMP: Personnel. DAVIS: You hired Steve Bannon to be the chief strategist for you in the White House. He is a hero of the  . He’s been described by some as racist and  . I wonder what message you think you have sent by elevating him to that position and what you would say to those who feel like that indicates something about the kind of country you prefer and the government you’ll run. TRUMP: Um, I’ve known Steve Bannon a long time. If I thought he was a racist, or   or any of the things that we can, you know, the terms we can use, I wouldn’t even think about hiring him. First of all, I’m the one that makes the decision, not Steve Bannon or anybody else. And Kellyanne will tell you that. [laughter] KELLYANE CONWAY: 100 percent. TRUMP: And if he said something to me that, in terms of his views, or that I thought were inappropriate or bad, number one I wouldn’t do anything, and number two, he would have to be gone. But I know many people that know him, and in fact, he’s actually getting some very good press from a lot of the people that know him, and people that are on the left. But Steve went to Harvard, he was a, you know, he was very successful, he was a Naval officer, he’s, I think he’s very, very, you know, sadly, really, I think it’s very hard on him. I think he’s having a hard time with it. Because it’s not him. It’s not him. I’ve known him for a long time. He’s a very, very smart guy. I think he was with Goldman Sachs on top of everything else. UNKNOWN: What do you make of the website he ran, Breitbart? TRUMP: The which? UNKNOWN: Breitbart. TRUMP: Well, Breitbart’s different. Breitbart cover things, I mean like The New York Times covers things. I mean, I could say that Arthur is   because they covered an   story. SULZBERGER: [laughing] I am, I am. I’ll take whatever you say. I am always right, but I’m not  . [laughter, cross talk] TRUMP: The New York Times covers a lot of stories that are, you know, rough stories. And you know, they have covered some of these things, but The New York Times covers a lot of these things also. It’s just a newspaper, essentially. It’s a newspaper. I know the guy, he’s a decent guy, he’s a very smart guy. He’s done a good job. He hasn’t been with me that long. You know he really came in after the primaries. I had already won the primaries. And if I thought that his views were in that category, I would immediately let him go. And I’ll tell you why. In many respects I think his views are actually on the other side of what a lot of people might think. DAVIS: But you are aware, sir, with all due respect, that   and Jews and many folks who disagree with the coverage of Breitbart and the slant that Breitbart brings to the news view him that way, aren’t you? TRUMP: Yeah, well Breitbart, first of all, is just a publication. And, you know, they cover stories like you cover stories. Now, they are certainly a much more conservative paper, to put it mildly, than The New York Times. But Breitbart really is a news organization that’s become quite successful, and it’s got readers and it does cover subjects that are on the right, but it covers subjects on the left also. I mean it’s a pretty big, it’s a pretty big thing. And he helped build it into a pretty successful news organization. Now, I’ll tell you what, I know him very well. I will say this, and I will say this, if I thought that strongly, if I thought that he was doing anything, or had any ideas that were different than the ideas that you would think, I would ask him very politely to leave. But in the meantime, I think he’s been treated very unfairly. It’s very interesting ’cause a lot of people are coming to his defense right now. PRIEBUS: We have never experienced a single episode of any of those accusations. It’s been the total opposite. It’s been a great team, and it’s just not there. And what the   is saying is 100 percent true. [cross talk] TRUMP: And by the way, if you see something or get something where you feel that I’m wrong, and you have some info  —   I would love to hear it. You can call me, Arthur can call me, I would love to hear. The only one who can’t call me is Maureen [Dowd, opinion columnist]. She treats me too rough. I don’t know what happened to Maureen! She was so good, Gail [Collins, opinion columnist]. For years she was so good. [cross talk] SULZBERGER: As we all say about Maureen, it’s not your fault, it’s just your turn. [laughter] ROSS DOUTHAT, opinion columnist: I have a slightly different, but somewhat Steve   question, I guess. It’s about the future of the Republican Party. You started out here talking about winning in so many states where no Republican has won in decades, especially Midwestern Rust Belt states. And I think many people think that one of the reasons you won was that you deliberately campaigned as a different kind of Republican. You had different things to say on trade, entitlements, foreign policy, even your daughter Ivanka’s child care plan was sort of distinctive. And now you’re in a situation where you’re governing and staffing up an administration with a Republican Party whose leaders, and Reince, may differ with me a little on this, but don’t always see    on those views. TRUMP: Although right now they’re loving me. [laughter] UNKNOWN: Well, right now they are. [cross talk] TRUMP: Paul Ryan right now loves me, Mitch McConnell loves me, it’s amazing how winning can change things. I’ve liked Chuck Schumer for a long time. I’ve actually, I’ve raised a lot of money for Chuck and given him a lot of money over the years. I think I was the first person that ever contributed to Chuck Schumer. I had a Brooklyn office, a little office, in a little apartment building in Brooklyn in Sheepshead Bay where I worked with my father. And Chuck Schumer came in and I gave him, I believe, I don’t know if he’s willing to admit this, but I believe it was his first campaign contribution, $500. But Chuck Schumer’s a good guy. I think we’ll get along very well. DOUTHAT: I guess that’s my question is, how much do you expect to be able to both run an administration and negotiate with a   Congress as a different kind of Republican. And do you worry that you’ll wake up three years from now and go back to campaigning in the Rust Belt and people will say, well, he governed more like Paul Ryan than like Donald Trump. TRUMP: No, I don’t worry about that. ’Cause I didn’t need to do this. I was telling Arthur before: ‘Arthur I didn’t need to do this. I’m doing this to do a good job.’ That’s what I want to do, and I think that what happened in the Rust Belt, they call it the Rust Belt for a reason. If you go through it, you look back 20 years, they didn’t used to call it the Rust Belt. You pass factory after factory after factory that’s empty and rusting. Rust is the good part, ’cause they’re worse than rusting, they’re falling down. No, I wouldn’t sacrifice that. To me more important is taking care of the people that really have proven to be, to love Donald Trump, as opposed to the political people. And frankly if the political people don’t take care of these people, they’re not going to win and you’re going to end up with maybe a total different kind of government than what you’re looking at right now. These people are really angry. They’re smart, they’re workers, and they’re angry. I call them the forgotten men and women. And I use that in speeches, I say they’re the forgotten people  —   they were totally forgotten. And we’re going to bring jobs back. We’re going to bring jobs back, big league. I’ve spoken to so many companies already, I say, don’t plan on moving your company, ’cause you’re not going to be able to move your company and sell us your product. You think you’re going to just sell it across what will be a strong border, you know at least we’re going to have a border. But just don’t plan on it. And I’ll tell you, I believe, and you’ll hear announcements over the next couple of months, but I believe I’ve talked numerous comp  —   in   conversations with top people  —   numerous companies that have, leaving, or potentially leaving our country with thousands of jobs. FRIEDMAN: Are you worried, though, that those companies will keep their factories here, but the jobs will be replaced by robots? TRUMP: They will, and we’ll make the robots too. [laughter] TRUMP: It’s a big thing, we’ll make the robots too. Right now we don’t make the robots. We don’t make anything. But we’re going to, I mean, look, robotics is becoming very big and we’re going to do that. We’re going to have more factories. We can’t lose 70, 000 factories. Just can’t do it. We’re going to start making things. I was honored yesterday, I got a call from Bill Gates, great call, we had a great conversation, I got a call from Tim Cook at Apple, and I said, ‘Tim, you know one of the things that will be a real achievement for me is when I get Apple to build a big plant in the United States, or many big plants in the United States, where instead of going to China, and going to Vietnam, and going to the places that you go to, you’re making your product right here.’ He said, ‘I understand that.’ I said: ‘I think we’ll create the incentives for you, and I think you’re going to do it. We’re going for a very large tax cut for corporations, which you’ll be happy about.’ But we’re going for big tax cuts, we have to get rid of regulations, regulations are making it impossible. Whether you’re liberal or conservative, I mean I could sit down and show you regulations that anybody would agree are ridiculous. It’s gotten to be a   . And companies can’t, they can’t even start up, they can’t expand, they’re choking. I tell you, one thing I would say, so, I’m giving a big tax cut and I’m giving big regulation cuts, and I’ve seen all of the small business owners over the United States, and all of the big business owners, I’ve met so many people. They are more excited about the regulation cut than about the tax cut. And I would’ve never said that’s possible, because the tax cut’s going to be substantial. You know we have companies leaving our country because the taxes are too high. But they’re leaving also because of the regulations. And I would say, of the two, and I would not have thought this, regulation cuts, substantial regulation cuts, are more important than, and more enthusiastically supported, than even the big tax cuts. UNKNOWN: Mr.   I wanted to ask you, there was a conference this past weekend in Washington of people who pledged their allegiance to Nazism. TRUMP: Boy, you are really into this stuff, huh? PRIEBUS: I think we answered that one right off the bat. UNKNOWN: Are you going to condemn them? TRUMP: Of course I did, of course I did. PRIEBUS: He already did. UNKNOWN: Are you going to do it right now? TRUMP: Oh, I see, maybe you weren’t here. Sure. Would you like me to do it here? I’ll do it here. Of course I condemn. I disavow and condemn. SULZBERGER: We’ll go with that. I’d like to move to infrastructure, apologies, and then we’ll go back. Because a lot of the investment you are talking about, a lot of the jobs you are talking about  —   is infrastructure going to be the core of your first few years? TRUMP: No, it’s not the core, but it’s an important factor. We’re going for a lot of things, between taxes, between regulations, between health care replacement, we’re going to talk repeal and replace. ’Cause health care is  —   you know people are paying a 100 percent increase and they’re not even getting anything, the deductibles are so high, you have deductibles $16, 000. So they’re paying all of this money and they don’t even get health care. So it’s very important. So there are a lot of things. But infrastructure, Arthur, is going to be a part of it. SULZBERGER: It’s part of jobs, isn’t it? TRUMP: I don’t even think it’s a big part of it. It’s going to be a big number but I think I am doing things that are more important than infrastructure, but infrastructure is still a part of it, and we’re talking about a very   infrastructure bill. And that’s not a very Republican thing  —   I didn’t even know that, frankly. SULZBERGER: It worked for Franklin Roosevelt. TRUMP: It didn’t work for Obama because unfortunately they didn’t spend the money last time on infrastructure. They spent it on a lot of other things. You know, nobody can find out where that last  —   you know, from a few years ago  —   where that money went. And we’re going to make sure it is spent on infrastructure and roads and highways. I have a friend, he’s a big trucker, one of the biggest. And he orders these incredible trucks, the best, I won’t mention the name but it’s a certain truck company that makes  —   they call them the   of trucks. You know, the most expensive trucks. And he calls me up about two months ago and he goes, ‘Man, I’m going to buy the cheapest trucks I can buy.’ And I said, ‘Why?’ and  —   you know, and this is the biggest guy  —   he goes, ‘My trucks are coming back, they’re going from New York to California and they’re all busted up. The highways are in such bad shape, they’re hitting potholes, they’re hitting everything.’ He said, ‘I’m not buying these trucks anymore, I’m going to buy the cheapest stuff and the strongest tires I can get.’ That’s the exact expression he used, ‘the cheapest trucks and the strongest tires.’ We’re hitting so many bad points, we, you know, I said, ‘So tell me, you’ve been doing this how long?’ 45 years. He built it over 45 years. I said, ‘Have you ever seen it like this?’ He said, ‘The roads have never been like this.’ It’s an interesting   …     BAQUET: What did, what did, I’m curious what Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan said when you said, ‘I’m going to launch a   infrastructure program.’ Are they reluctant to spend that? TRUMP: Honestly right now   …     DOUTHAT: Trillion. Trillion, I think, was the figure. BAQUET: Because they would be in the wing of the Republican Party that would say, ‘That’s great, but you’re not going to be able to do that and balance the budget.’ TRUMP: Let’s see if I get it done. Right now they’re in love with me. O. K.? Four weeks ago they weren’t in love with me. Don’t forget  —   if I read The New York Times, and you don’t have to put this on the record  —   it can be if you want, you might not want   …     SULZBERGER: You say if, but you do   …     TRUMP: Well, I do read it. Unfortunately. I would have lived about 20 years longer if I didn’t. SULZBERGER: There’s Nixon’s quote right there if you’d love to reread it  —   TRUMP: I know. But when you look at the different, all the newspapers, I was going to lose the presidency, I was going to take the House with me, and the Senate had no chance. It was going to be the biggest humiliation in the history of politics in this country. And instead I won the presidency, easily, and I mean easily  —   you look at those states, I had states where I won by 30 and 40 points. I won the presidency easily, I helped numerous senators  —   in fact the only senators that didn’t get elected were two  —   one up in New Hampshire who refused to say that she was going to vote for me, who by the way would love a job in the administration and I said, ‘No, thank you.’ That’s on the record. This is where I’m different than a politician  —   I know what to say, I just believe it’s sort of interesting. She’d love to have a job in the administration, I said, ‘No, thank you.’ She refused to vote for me. And a senator in Nevada who frankly said, he endorsed me then he unendorsed me, and he went down like a lead balloon. And then they called me before the race and said they wanted me to endorse him and do a big thing and I said, ‘No thank you, good luck.’ You know, let’s see what happens. I said, off the record, I hope you lose. Off the record. He was! He was up by 10 points  —   you know who I’m talking about. So, others  —   if you look at Missouri, [Senator Roy] Blunt, he was down five points a few days before the election, he called for help, I gave him help, and I think I was up like over 30 points in Missouri. I was leading by a massive amount, 28 points. I gave him help and he ended up winning by four points or something. I brought a number of them. Pennsylvania, brought over the finish line. Let’s see, we brought Johnson, in, you know, that was a good one. We brought him over the line in Wisconsin. Winning Wisconsin was big stuff, that’s something that   …     FRIEDMAN: Mr.   I came   …     TRUMP: So right now I’m in very good shape, but FRIEDMAN: I came here thinking you’d be awed and overwhelmed by this job, but I feel like you are getting very comfortable with it. TRUMP: I feel comfortable. I feel comfortable. I am awed by the job, as anybody would be, but I honestly, Tom, I feel so comfortable and you know it would be, to me, a great achievement if I could come back here in a year or two years and say  —   and have a lot of the folks here say, ‘You’ve done a great job.’ And I don’t mean just a conservative job, ’cause I’m not talking conservative. I mean just, we’ve done a good job. SHEAR: To follow up on Matt, after you met with President Obama, he described you to folks as  —   that you seemed overwhelmed by what he told you. So I wonder if you are overwhelmed by the magnitude of the job that you’re about to inherit and if you can tell us anything more about that conversation with the president and the apparently subsequent conversations that you’ve had on the phone since then. And then maybe talk a little bit about foreign policy, that’s something we haven’t touched on here, and whether or not you believe in the kind of world order  —   a world order led by America in terms of having this country underwrite the security and the free markets of the world, which have been in place for decades. TRUMP: Sure. I had a great meeting with President Obama. I never met him before. I really liked him a lot. The meeting was supposed to be 10 minutes, 15 minutes max, because there were a lot of people waiting outside, for both of us. And it ended up being  —   you were there  —   I guess an     meeting, close. And it was a great chemistry. I think if he said overwhelmed, I don’t think he meant that in a bad way. I think he meant that it is a very overwhelming job. But I’m not overwhelmed by it. You can do things and fix it, I think he meant it that way. He said very nice things after the meeting and I said very nice things about him. I really enjoyed my meeting with him. We have  —   you know, we come from different sides of the equation, but it’s nevertheless something that  —   I didn’t know if I’d like him. I probably thought that maybe I wouldn’t, but I did, I did like him. I really enjoyed him a lot. I’ve spoken to him since the meeting. SHEAR: What did you say to him? TRUMP: Just a basic conversation. I think he’s looking to do absolutely the right thing for the country in terms of transition and I really, I’m telling you, we had a meeting, Arthur, that went for an hour and a half that could have gone for three or four hours. It was a great  —   it was just a very good meeting. UNKNOWN: Sort of like this meeting. [cross talk, laughter] TRUMP: He told me what he thought his, what the biggest problems of the country were, which I don’t think I should reveal, I don’t mind if he reveals them. But I was actually surprised a little bit. But he told me the problems, he told me things that he considered assets, but he did tell me what he thought were the biggest problems, in particular one problem that he thought was a big problem for the country, which I’d rather have you ask him. But I really found the meeting to be very good. And I hope we can have a good  —   I mean, it doesn’t mean we’re going to agree on everything, but I hope that we will have a great   relationship. I really liked him a lot and I’m a little bit surprised I’m telling you that I really liked him a lot. Let’s go foreign policy, sure. Sure. FRIEDMAN: What do you see as America’s role in the world? Do you believe that the role   …     TRUMP: That’s such a big question. FRIEDMAN: The role that we played for 50 years as kind of the global balancer, paying more for things because they were in our ultimate interest, one hears from you, I sense, is really shrinking that role. TRUMP: I don’t think we should be a nation builder. I think we’ve tried that. I happen to think that going into Iraq was perhaps   …     I mean you could say maybe we could have settled the civil war, O. K.? I think going into Iraq was one of the great mistakes in the history of our country. I think getting out of it  —   I think we got out of it wrong, then lots of bad things happened, including the formation of ISIS. We could have gotten out of it differently. FRIEDMAN: NATO, Russia? TRUMP: I think going in was a terrible, terrible mistake. Syria, we have to solve that problem because we are going to just keep fighting, fighting forever. I have a different view on Syria than everybody else. Well, not everybody else, but then a lot of people. I had to listen to [Senator] Lindsey Graham, who, give me a break. I had to listen to Lindsey Graham talk about, you know, attacking Syria and attacking, you know, and it’s like you’re now attacking Russia, you’re attacking Iran, you’re attacking. And what are we getting? We’re getting  —   and what are we getting? And I have some very definitive, I have some very strong ideas on Syria. I think what’s happened is a horrible, horrible thing. To look at the deaths, and I’m not just talking deaths on our side, which are horrible, but the deaths  —   I mean you look at these cities, Arthur, where they’re totally, they’re rubble, massive areas, and they say two people were injured. No, thousands of people have died. O. K. And I think it’s a shame. And ideally we can get  —   do something with Syria. I spoke to Putin, as you know, he called me, essentially   …     UNKNOWN: How do you see that relationship? TRUMP: Essentially everybody called me, all of the major leaders, and most of them I’ve spoken to. FRIEDMAN: Will you have a reset with Russia? TRUMP: I wouldn’t use that term after what happened, you know, previously. I think  —   I would love to be able to get along with Russia and I think they’d like to be able to get along with us. It’s in our mutual interest. And I don’t go in with any preconceived notion, but I will tell you, I would say  —   when they used to say, during the campaign, Donald Trump loves Putin, Putin loves Donald Trump, I said, huh, wouldn’t it be nice, I’d say this in front of thousands of people, wouldn’t it be nice to actually report what they said, wouldn’t it be nice if we actually got along with Russia, wouldn’t it be nice if we went after ISIS together, which is, by the way, aside from being dangerous, it’s very expensive, and ISIS shouldn’t have been even allowed to form, and the people will stand up and give me a massive hand. You know they thought it was bad that I was getting along with Putin or that I believe strongly if we can get along with Russia that’s a positive thing. It is a great thing that we can get along with not only Russia but that we get along with other countries. JOSEPH KAHN, managing editor: On Syria, would you mind, you said you have a very strong idea about what to do with the Syria conflict, can you describe that for us? TRUMP: I can only say this: We have to end that craziness that’s going on in Syria. One of the things that was told to me  —   can I say this off the record, or is everything on the record? SULZBERGER: No, if you want to   …     TRUMP: I don’t want to violate, I don’t want to violate a   …     SULZBERGER: If you want to go off the record, we have agreed you can go off the record. Ladies and gentlemen, we are off the record for this moment. [Trump speaks off the record.] TRUMP: Now we can go back on. SULZBERGER: I’m going to play the cop here. We’ve got only two and a half minutes left, because they have a hard stop at 2. And by the way, I want to thank you again, on behalf of all of us   …     TRUMP: Thank you. SULZBERGER:   …     for this meeting, and really I mean that. We are back on the record. Maggie, you get the last question. TRUMP: Is he a tough boss, folks? Is he tough? HABERMAN: I have two questions, very, very quickly. One is your vice   left open the idea of returning to waterboarding. You talked about that on the campaign trail. I’m hoping you can talk about how you view torture at this point, and also what are you hoping that Jared Kushner will do in your administration and will you bring him in formally? TRUMP: O. K. O. K. So, I didn’t hear the second question. HABERMAN: Jared Kushner. What will Jared Kushner’s role be in your administration? TRUMP: Oh. Maybe nothing. Because I don’t want to have people saying ‘conflict.’ Even though the president of the United States  —   I hope whoever is writing this story, it’s written fairly  —   the president of the United States is allowed to have whatever conflicts he wants  —   he or she wants. But I don’t want to go by that. Jared’s a very smart guy. He’s a very good guy. The people that know him, he’s a quality person and I think he can be very helpful. I would love to be able to be the one that made peace with Israel and the Palestinians. I would love that, that would be such a great achievement. Because nobody’s been able to do it. HABERMAN: Do you think he can be part of that? TRUMP: Well, I think he’d be very good at it. I mean he knows it so well. He knows the region, knows the people, knows the players. I would love to be  —   and you can put that down in a list of many things that I’d like to be able to do. Now a lot of people tell me, really great people tell me, that it’s impossible, you can’t do it. I’ve had a lot of, actually, great Israeli businesspeople tell me, you can’t do that, it’s impossible. I disagree, I think you can make peace. I think people are tired now of being shot, killed. At some point, when do they come? I think we can do that. I have reason to believe I can do that. HABERMAN: And on torture? Where are you  —   and waterboarding? TRUMP: So, I met with General Mattis, who is a very respected guy. In fact, I met with a number of other generals, they say he’s the finest there is. He is being seriously, seriously considered for secretary of defense, which is  —   I think it’s time maybe, it’s time for a general. Look at what’s going on. We don’t win, we can’t beat anybody, we don’t win anymore. At anything. We don’t win on the border, we don’t win with trade, we certainly don’t win with the military. General Mattis is a strong, highly dignified man. I met with him at length and I asked him that question. I said, what do you think of waterboarding? He said  —   I was surprised  —   he said, ‘I’ve never found it to be useful.’ He said, ‘I’ve always found, give me a pack of cigarettes and a couple of beers and I do better with that than I do with torture.’ And I was very impressed by that answer. I was surprised, because he’s known as being like the toughest guy. And when he said that, I’m not saying it changed my mind. [An earlier version made a mistake in transcription. Mr. Trump said “changed my mind,” not “changed my man. ”] Look, we have people that are chopping off heads and drowning people in steel cages and we’re not allowed to waterboard. But I’ll tell you what, I was impressed by that answer. It certainly does not  —   it’s not going to make the kind of a difference that maybe a lot of people think. If it’s so important to the American people, I would go for it. I would be guided by that. But General Mattis found it to be very less important, much less important than I thought he would say. I thought he would say  —   you know he’s known as Mad Dog Mattis, right? Mad Dog for a reason. I thought he’d say ‘It’s phenomenal, don’t lose it.’ He actually said, ‘No, give me some cigarettes and some drinks, and we’ll do better.’ SULZBERGER: So, I, with apologies, I’m going to go to our C. E. O. Mark Thompson, for the last, last question. TRUMP: Very powerful man   …     MARK THOMPSON: Thank you, and it’s a really short one, but after all the talk about libel and libel laws, are you committed to the First Amendment to the Constitution? TRUMP: Oh, I was hoping he wasn’t going to say that. I think you’ll be happy. I think you’ll be happy. Actually, somebody said to me on that, they said, ‘You know, it’s a great idea, softening up those laws, but you may get sued a lot more.’ I said, ‘You know, you’re right, I never thought about that.’ I said, ‘You know, I have to start thinking about that.’ So, I, I think you’ll be O. K. I think you’re going to be fine. SULZBERGER: Well, thank you very much for this. Really appreciate this. TRUMP: Thank you all, very much, it’s a great honor. I will say, The Times is, it’s a great, great American jewel. A world jewel. And I hope we can all get along. We’re looking for the same thing, and I hope we can all get along well."

Paxton filed a brief today in federal court in support of stopping the   show. [“It is vital that governmental entities have the ability to exclude   businesses from property that they own,” General Paxton said. “The City of Dallas, through its   officials, has rightfully decided that its convention center should not be home to an event where obscenity and criminal activity occurs. A federal court should not overturn that decision by elected officials. ”  The amici curiae (friend of the court) brief was filed in the U. S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas. The brief attached below, urges that because the Convention Center is a commercial enterprise that is intended to promote economic development in Dallas, the Convention Center is a nonpublic forum that the City is free to reasonably manage under applicable law. The OAG also urges that it hopes by filing the brief that it will “aid the Court in understanding how free speech doctrine accommodates the City’s significant interests as proprietor of the Convention Center. ” “I’m proud to be joined by the Dallas Citizens Council on this brief,” General Paxton said in a statement obtained by Breitbart Texas. “Promoting an environment where economic development can flourish in Texas is an important goal for my administration.

306,Egypt’s ex-President Mohamed Morsy sentenced to death,2015-05-16,"Cairo (CNN) Former Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy was sentenced Saturday by a Cairo court to death    the latest judicial setback for the ousted leader. He was convicted in a 2011 prison break. Morsy’s name, along with those of more than 100 other defendants, will be passed to the Grand Mufti, the highest legal authority in Egypt, who will have the final say on their sentence. The verdict will be confirmed June 2. This was the harshest sentence that Morsy could have expected to receive in the case.  The leader of the Muslim Brotherhood, Mohamed Badie, and a former parliament speaker, Mohamed Saad   also were referred to the Grand Mufti in the jailbreak case. Cairo’s   government has banned the Muslim Brotherhood, branding it a terrorist group    an allegation it denies.  Morsy and his   were accused of collaborating with the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas and the Lebanese Shiite group Hezbollah to break into several prisons across Egypt in January 2011 and of facilitating the escape of Morsy and 20, 000 others. The jailbreak came amid the chaos of the January 2011 popular uprising that toppled longtime strongman Hosni Mubarak and led to Morsy’s election the following year. Rights group: Trials a ”charade” Muslim Brotherhood lawyer Abdel Moniem Abdel Maqsoud told CNN that the defense would have to consult with Morsy before deciding whether to lodge an appeal on his behalf. Morsy has said throughout the process ”that he doesn’t recognize these trials,” the lawyer said.  Maqsoud characterized Saturday’s ruling as ”a decision, not a verdict.” ”Consequently we will wait until June 2,” he said. ”If there is a conviction, we will continue the legal path that we started the past months, which is to point the legal faults of these verdicts.” He said he believed the Court of Cassation would overturn all the verdicts handed down. Rights group Amnesty International condemned the trials of Morsy and others as a ”charade” which demonstrated the ”deplorable state” of Egypt’s criminal justice system. Condemning Morsy to death ”shows a complete disregard for human rights. His trials were undermined even before he set foot in the courtroom,” said Said Boumedouha, deputy director of Amnesty International’s Middle East and North Africa program.  He urged Egypt to ensue the independence and impartiality of the justice system, saying most of those sentenced to death by its courts since July 2013 have been Morsy supporters. ”The death penalty has become the favorite tool for the Egyptian authorities to purge the political opposition,” he said. Hamas criticized the death sentences handed down for some of its members in connection with the jailbreak    pointing out that two of the named defendants were already dead. ”Hossam   was martyred in 2008. Martyr leader Raed   was martyred the 2014 war. Today, the Egyptian judiciary sentenced them to death. Fair judiciary indeed,” Ismail Haniyyeh, the deputy head of the Hamas politburo, tweeted.  He noted that another Palestinian sentenced to death, Hassan Salama, has been in Israeli prisons since 1996.  Espionage case, In a separate case involving espionage charges, another 16 defendants    but not Morsy    were also sentenced to death. The verdict will be confirmed June 2.  Among those sentenced to death are Mohamed   deputy leader of the Muslim Brotherhood Mohamed   a former Muslim Brotherhood member of parliament Ahmed Abdel Aty, a former presidential aide and Emad Shahin, a political science professor now in the United States. Those defendants present chanted ”Allahu Akbar,” meaning ”God is the greatest,” as they were sentenced. They remained in the cage where prisoners are held in the courtroom, waving to journalists and lawyers as they chanted. Morsy can expect to learn his verdict in the espionage case on June 2, but it won’t be the death penalty. Violence against protesters, Morsy, who became Egypt’s first democratically elected President in June 2012, was deposed by a popularly backed military coup in July 2013. He was already sentenced to 20 years in prison in April this year on charges involving violence against protesters outside the presidential palace in December 2012. But he was acquitted of murder in the deaths of protesters. After that verdict, his Freedom and Justice Party, the Muslim Brotherhood’s political wing, called the trial a ”travesty of justice.” The ousted president is still facing an ongoing trial on charges of espionage with Qatar. A fifth trial will start this month on charges of insulting the judiciary."
307,"Trump Expands Big Lead In Florida, Up In Ohio - Breitbart",2016-03-09,"Two pollsters looked at two crucial states and delivered only good news for Republican frontrunner Donald Trump. The GOP Establishment’s stated goal is to stop Trump from winning the number of delegates necessary to outright claim the Republican presidential nomination. The idea is to then go to a brokered convention where Party delegates get to choose whomever they like. In order to do that, Trump must first lose the     of Ohio and Florida. With just six days to go, these polls show Trump  leading in both.    Florida, According to Quinnipiac, despite 10 days of facing down the GOP   Media Death Star, Trump has actually expanded his lead in Florida. Currently, the billionaire businessman leads favorite son Marco Rubio 45% to 22% a full +23 points. Last month, in this same poll, Trump was up by just +16 points over Rubio, 44% to 28%. Only 6% of voters remain undecided. Ted Cruz earns 18% support. John Kasich sits at just 8%. Trump also leads in the demos: Trump leads Rubio 39  —   27 percent among women and 50  —   17 percent among men.   Tea Party members go 48 percent for Trump, 40 percent for Cruz and 9 percent for Rubio. Trump gets 39 percent of white,   evangelicals, with 30 percent for Cruz and 21 percent for Rubio. In the new CNN poll, Trump is up +16 with 40% to Rubio’s 24%. Cruz sits at 19% Kasich 5%.   Ohio, The race for Ohio is much tighter. According to Quinnipiac, Trump leads current Ohio Governor Kasich by +6 points, 38% to 32%. A month ago, Trump led by +5 points, 31% to 26%. Both men are gaining support. The good news for Trump is that his lead has remained stable. Cruz earns just 16% support. Rubio’s collapse continues with just 9%. Details: Cruz gets 38 percent of Ohio Tea Party members, with 33 percent for Trump and 14 percent for Kasich. Kasich gets 32 percent of white,   evangelicals, with 29 percent for Trump and 24 percent for Cruz. Voters 18 to 44 years old go to Trump over Kasich 41  —   24 percent. Trump gets 38 percent of voters 45 to 64 years old to Kasich’s 35 percent. Kasich gets 38 percent of voters over 65 years old to Trump’s 33 percent. In the new CNN poll, Trump is again up +6 with 41% to Kasich’s 35%. Cruz is in third at 15% and Rubio fourth with just 7%. Kasich’s third place showing in Michigan Tuesday night might deflate some of his Ohio support. He has virtually no chance of winning the nomination. If his comeback was going to begin, it had to begin in Michigan, a state close to and very similar to Ohio. If any, whatever kitchen sinks the Establishment and DC Media have left, they had better be more effective than the last ones.   Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC                "
308,MIT Technology Review: Google’s A.I. ’Hate Speech’ Detector ’Erratic’ - Breitbart,2017-02-27,"The MIT Technology Review recently published an article demonstrating that Google’s new comment detection system, Perspective, seems to have difficulty differentiating offensive words or controversial subjects from actual hate speech. [Breitbart previously reported on the “hate speech” detection software, designed to help online publications clear their article comment sections of any offensive content that could potentially be applied to other Internet platforms. The MIT Technology Review decided to test the accuracy of the software, which analyzes comments on a scale of   for “toxicity. ” Toxic comments are defined by the program as “a rude, disrespectful, or unreasonable comment that is likely to make you leave a discussion. ”  “Trump sucks” scored a colossal 96 percent, yet   codeword “ ” only scored 5 percent. “Few Muslims are a terrorist threat” was 79 percent toxic, while “race war now” scored 24 percent. “Hitler was an  ” scored 70 percent, but “Hitler was not an  ” scored only 53% and “The Holocaust never happened” scored only 21%. And while “gas the joos” scored 29 percent, rephrasing it to “Please gas the joos. Thank you. ” lowered the score to a mere 7 percent. (“Jews are human,” however, scores 72 percent. “Jews are not human”? 64 percent.) The MIT Technology Review believes the system is designed to detect particular words and phrases in a sentence that may be deemed offensive but does not account for the meaning behind these words. In an example, the word “rape” scored a toxicity rating as high as 77 percent when detected by the program, but a statement such as “rape is a horrible crime” actually rated higher at 81 percent. Curse words receive similar treatment: “I fucking love this” was rated at a 94 percent on the toxicity scale, which is supposed to indicate if a comment is “rude, disrespectful, or unreasonable. ” We may say “Trolls are stupid” (toxicity score 96 percent) but the language of toxicity and harassment is often rich in ways that   systems can’t handle. The comment “You should be made into a lamp,” an allusion to claims that skin from concentration camp victims was used for lampshades, has been thrown at a number of journalists and other public figures in recent months. It scores just 4 percent on Perspective. But best not reply by saying “You are a Nazi,” because that’s an 87 percent. Read the full article by MIT Technology Review here.

309,Bernie Sanders’s Socialist Allies Helped Shut Down Donald Trump’s Chicago Event - Breitbart,2016-03-14,"One of the radical groups that helped to shut down Donald Trump’s Chicago rally has long maintained a close relationship with Sen. Bernie Sanders. [In fact, Sanders raised funds for the group, the Democratic Socialists of America, or DSA, and himself helped to recruit new members to the socialist organization.  Sanders further was a key player in helping to elect   candidates to Congress and was involved in an effort to rebrand and incorporate that   legislative axis within the Congressional Progressive Caucus, or CPC. The DSA in turn was critical in organizing early support for Sanders’ national political career and Sanders has since maintained close working ties to the organization. Sanders was one of six founding members of the CPC. It was also founded in 1991 by Reps. Peter DeFazio,  . Maxine Waters,  . and Ron Dellums,  . The story of Sanders, the CPC and the DSA spotlights the largely forgotten but entirely public role the DSA played in founding the CPC, the largest membership organization within the House Democratic Caucus, currently boasting   members. Besides the DSA, the George     MoveOn. org played a prominent role in organizing the   activism. DSA ‘Disruptors’ sent to Trump event, On Sunday, Trump sent out the following Tweet: Bernie Sanders is lying when he says his disruptors aren’t told to go to my events. Be careful Bernie, or my supporters will go to yours!  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 13, 2016,  Sanders in turn said on Sunday that Trump is “lying” by claiming Sanders campaign sent protesters to the business mogul’s canceled Chicago rally. While Sanders’ campaign may not have been directly involved, the DSA certainly sent its members to the Chicago event. The DSA’s Chicago chapter is the Chicago DSA, which is separately incorporated and is one of the most active branches of the DSA. Anyone paying membership dues to the DSA in the Chicago area is automatically a member of the Chicago DSA local, the website documents. Chicago DSA drove its members to the Trump Protest Rally on March 11 at the University of Illinois at Chicago Pavilion in Chicago, the   arena where Trump had planned his local campaign event.  The event was canceled at the last minute due to safety concerns, with protesters clashing with Trump supporters at the nixed rally. The Chicago DSA website linked to the main Facebook page that provided details for the   rally, which announced it had planned to “make our way to the Pavilion in solidarity. ” The Facebook page provided a link for activists to sign up to get inside Trump’s campaign event, purportedly to infiltrate and disrupt the Trump rally. The Chicago DSA is one of over a dozen organizations that drove its members to the Trump event in Chicago.  Other groups, some larger, included Black Lives Matter Chicago, MoveOn. org, La Raza Chicago, International ANSWER Chicago, SEIU Local 73, The Illinois Coalition of Immigrant and Refugee Rights, and more. Chicago DSA is currently actively campaigning for Sanders, participating in numerous events and marches in support of the presidential candidate and drafting petitions to support his bid. The DSA’s own super PAC has been supporting Sanders. The ties between Sanders and the DSA run deep and encompass over two decades of mutual activism. The DSA has worked to utilize the Democratic Party  to push its socialist agenda. “Stress our Democratic Party strategy and electoral work,” instructs an organizing document of the DSA. “The Democratic Party is something the public understands, and association with it takes the edge off. Stressing our Democratic Party work will establish some distance from the radical subculture and help integrate you to the milieu of the young liberals. ” DSA aided Sanders political rise, This reporter previously first documented the DSA’s role in helping to organize support for Sanders’ national political career: On Oct. 24, 1988, The Nation magazine, identifying Sanders as “the socialist Mayor of Burlington, Vermont,” reported he had been endorsed for Congress by both the Democratic Socialists of America and the progressive founders of Ben and Jerry’s Ice Cream. The DSA endorsed Sanders for every one of his subsequent elections and has openly helped to raise funds for him over the years. In 2006, for example, the DSA boasted in its literature about the socialist group’s “involvement in Bernie Sanders’ pivotal independent 2006 Senate campaign in Vermont. ” Indeed, the DSA held “Elect Sanders” house parties in Atlanta Boston Detroit Portland, Maine Boulder, Colorado Indianapolis Columbus, Ohio Ithaca, New York Springfield, Massachusetts Washington, D. C. and New York City. “DSAers wanting to hold Sanders house parties should contact me at fllewellyn@dsausa. org,” wrote one senior DSA activist in the socialist group’s July 2006 newsletter. That same year, Sanders spoke at a Detroit fundraiser for DSA’s Political Action Committee. The fundraiser was connected by telephone link to a simultaneous DSA fundraising event in Atlanta. DSA literature notes that in January 2006, DSA Detroit Chair David Green “took Bernie Sanders to tour Stan Ovshinsky’s United Solar Ovonics plant in Auburn Hills northwest of Detroit. ” “The plant makes successful,   solar panels and is pioneering the hydrogen fuel cell,” added the DSA. Sanders helped recruit new members to the DSA. In one example, he was the featured speaker at numerous DSA “house parties” in the fall of 2006 that were aimed not only at garnering support for his senatorial bid but also used by the DSA to recruit new members to its ranks. As this reporter previously documented: One New York City event was held Sept. 19, 2006, at the home of DSA activists Gene and Laurel Eisner on Manhattan’s Upper West Side. “The questions and comments actually had to be cut off to let Bernie get to the plane,” reported the DSA. DSA reported the Sanders events helped to recruit new members to the socialist organization. “Sanders support work provides a natural vehicle in any locality for DSA to reach out to  —   and potentially recruit  —   unaffiliated socialists and independent radicals. ” Infiltrating Congress, hosting CPC website, The DSA’s role in openly helping to found the CPC has been documented but largely forgotten. Chicago DSA’s New Ground publication identified the Progressive Caucus in Congress as a group which the DSA “helped to organize. ” The ties were so close that until November 2002, the CPC’s websute was openly hosted by the DSA’s own website. However, after numerous news media outlets pointed to the connection, the online list of CPC members was relocated to Sanders’ own website before getting its own website. The radicalism of the DSA’s website was openly brandished. In 1998, it featured “The Internationale,” the worldwide anthem of communism and socialism, WND. com reported. The website also featured the song titled “Red Revolution,” which was supposed to be sung to the tune of “Red Robin. ” The lyrics, WND noted, include: “When the Red Revolution brings its solution along, along, there’ll be no more lootin’ when we start shootin’ that Wall Street throng.   …    ” Also: “Are you sleeping? Are you sleeping? Bourgeoisie, Bourgeoisie. And when the revolution comes, We’ll kill you all with knives and guns, Bourgeoisie, Bourgeoisie. ” The CPC being hosted on the DSA’s website is noted in the Congressional record. This reporter previously documented: The issue of the CPC being hosted on the DSA website rose again in June 2000 in connection with a heated dispute on the House floor among Rep. Randy “Duke” Cunningham,  . Rep. Peter DeFazio,  . and David R. Obey,  . over the “merits of the   fighter plane. ” When Cunningham stood to defend himself, he included in his argument the fact that the relationship between the CPC and DSA was an open secret. The CPC was still hosted by the DSA website in April 2002. On April 23, 2002, Author and political philosopher Balint Vazsonyi noted the connection in the Washington Times when he asked: “‘What?’ I hear you say. ‘Socialists in the Congress of the United States? ’” Dozens, dear reader, dozens. And they make no secret of it. Although of late it has been refurbished and the address altered, they have their own Web site. They call themselves members of the Progressive Caucus, until recently an arm of the Democratic Socialists of America, itself an arm of the Socialist International. The Progressive Caucus may be a separate entity now, but the details of its program, as advertised on the website, are indistinguishable from that of the Socialist International. To their credit, they make no secret of it. Only the rest of us prefer not to believe it. In an earlier article in November 2002, Vazsonyi further highlighted the presence of the CPC on the DSA website.  With research by Brenda J. Elliott.

310,A scientific tale of two dresses,2015-02-27," (CNN) Before you strangle your best friend who sees the colors in the   dress differently than you do, please know that there’s a scientific explanation.  It has to do with the tiny cones in the back of our eyeballs that perceive colors in a slightly different way depending upon our genes. ”Why do some people love cilantro and others say it tastes like soap? Why do some people have perfect pitch and others are tone deaf? It’s the same with vision  —   our sensory apparatus is fine tuned,” says Dr. Julia Haller, the    at Wills Eye Hospital in Philadelphia.  The cones in our retinas  —   the fine layer of nerve tissue that lines the back of our eyes  —   detect the blue, green, and red in an image. The cones and your brain mix those colors to make other colors. ”  percent of the time, we’ll see the same colors,” Haller says. ”But the picture of this dress seems to have tints that hit the sweet spot that’s confusing to a lot of people.”  The very top section of the dress appears gold to some people, but black to others. This makes sense to Haller.  ”One of the typical color confusions we see is ” she says. ”So perhaps in this dress, the black has a bit of blue and the gold has a bit of yellow.”  As retinal specialists met Friday in Scottsdale, Arizona, at the annual meeting of the Macula Society, they swapped theories about why people’s cones and brains process the dress’s colors so differently.  One theory has to do with evolutionary biology. Primates, including humans, have developed an excellent sense of color, so we’re able to, for example, distinguish the yellow fruit hanging on the green tree.  To determine the color of that fruit, it’s often necessary to factor out colors in the light around it that might give the fruit a different and misleading tint. There are likely slight variations in how our brains do this automatic filtering.  ”Your brain is constantly estimating the color of the light that’s falling on the object and factoring that light out,” said Wallace Thoreson, a professor of ophthalmology at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. ”Each of us makes slightly different unconscious assumptions.”  Opinion: Why the dress, llamas and Spock went viral, Haller said the Macula Society’s meeting was ”totally derailed by the dress” as doctors skipped sessions to stand out in the hallway and compare each other’s color judgments.  Some of them even think the dress could possibly help advance medical science and hopefully help people with vision problems.  Dr. Emily Chew, an ophthalmologist at the National Institutes of Health, said in more than thirty years of research she’s never seen an image where people, all with normal vision, have had such dramatically different responses.  ”It would be interesting to use this image to learn more about the pathways of how we understand color,” said Chew, the deputy director of the division of epidemiology and clinical applications at the National Eye Institute.  She said it was impressive how ”crowd sourcing” identified the dress.   ”It would be really hard to create this image,” she said. ”It’s serendipitous. I’ve never seen anything like this. It’s really unbelievable.”  CNN’s Nadia Kounang contributed to this report."
311,"Limbaugh: Virginia Shooter the Personification of ’the Lunatic Fringe Base, the Deranged Base of the Democrat Party’ - Breitbart",2017-06-14,"Wednesday on his nationally syndicated radio show, conservative talker Rush Limbaugh reacted to a shooting at a congressional baseball practice in Alexandria, VA that had resulted in five people hospitalized, including House Majority Whip Rep. Steve Scalise ( ).  Limbaugh argued the shooter, identified as James T. Hodgkinson of Illinois, was influenced by the media and the Democratic Party stoking hatred and resentment. Partial transcript as follows (courtesy of RushLimbaugh. com): The sad and unfortunate fact is that, as evidenced by the sound bite of me yesterday, I have foreseen this coming. You can’t continue to enrage people the way the left, and predominantly the media, has been doing. The Democrat Party and the left for years have been feeding this. And particularly since the election of Trump they have virtually assured their supporters that Trump is guilty, guilty of treason. And every congressional hearing is going to provide the proof. Every one. Sessions yesterday, Comey a couple of times, Sally Yates, you name it. They build up these expectations that Trump is not really the president. He shouldn’t have been. He cheated. He colluded with the Russians. There isn’t any evidence for it, and so every time the left builds up an event where this is going to be established as fact and it blows up in their faces, it creates rising expectations followed immediately by rank disappointment and anger and letdown over the fact that it’s not happening. And I think these people on the left have been driven to this extreme for quite a while. I have been worried about it for I don’t know how long. And I’ve been telling you so. And we could, if we wanted to, we could scour  —   well, we have. I could go back and show you tweets, I could read you tweets. I could read you statements made by elected Democrats and others promoting just this kind of behavior, just this kind of behavior. You can find it. If you look at the TV programs and the media personalities that this guy, Hodgkinson, was devoted to, you’ll find out how radicalized he was by   TV and comedy. Last week Tonight With John Oliver, the Nightly Show on the Comedy Central, Democracy Now, The Ed Show, the Rachel Maddow Show. He apparently loved Rachel Maddow, wanted her to run for president. The Daily Show on Comedy Central, Real Time with Bill Maher. Those are the TV shows that he recommended everybody watch. Clearly, he was radicalized. Now, I also want to say he probably started off this way. I don’t know that this guy’s ever been a rational, invisible functioning member of a community, but at some point he got radicalized, and if you dig deep you’ll find  —   we’ve got examples of it to share with you. This guy is the exact personification when I sit here and talk about the lunatic fringe base, the deranged base of the Democrat Party, this is the guy. This is the face. This is the picture. This is what you get when you stoke and fuel hatred, raw hatred and resentment, at some point it’s gonna blow over, because it cannot be contained, this kind of rage and repeated disappointment. You add climate change probably to this guy’s list of grievances, and I think everybody ought to take a step back and realize this guy is not isolated. This guy is probably typical. Not that there’s going to be rampant shootings, but he just happened to go over the edge and pull the trigger. But he, to me, is exactly what I am unfortunately worried about when I look at the way all of these lies and all these nothingness, nothing burger stories have now been out there for month after month after month. And you add everything else that the Democrat and the liberal media agenda is. It’s nothing but anger, it’s nothing but rage, it’s nothing but hatred, and it has to have an outlet. And they know it. The fact is, they know it. Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor"
312,Putin warns against ’intimidating’ North Korea,2017-05-15,"Beijing  (CNN) Russian President Vladimir Putin has condemned North Korea’s latest missile launch as ”dangerous” but warned against ”intimidating” Pyongyang. Speaking in China, Putin called for a peaceful solution to the ongoing tensions on the Korean peninsula, Russia’s Sputnik news agency reported. ”I would like to confirm that we are categorically against the expansion of the club of nuclear states, including through the Korean Peninsula,” Putin told reporters. ”We are against it and consider it counterproductive, damaging, dangerous,” he said. But in comments that appeared aimed at the US, he said that ”intimidating (North Korea) is unacceptable.” For its part, North Korea said the missile test was in response to the nuclear dangers and threats posed by the US and its followers. ”We will conduct ICBM tests anytime and anywhere in accordance with the decisions made by our central leadership,” North Korea’s ambassador to China Ji Jae Ryong said at an impromptu press conference at the country’s embassy in Beijing Monday. US territory in reach? North Korea tested a   missile Sunday which reached an altitude of 2, 111. 5 kilometers (1, 312 miles) and flew 787 kilometers (489 miles) according to state news agency KCNA.  Analysts estimated its ranged as 4, 500 kilometers which would put the US territory of Guam within its  reach.  A small island in the Pacific, Guam is home to Andersen Air Force Base, through which the US Air Force rotates heavy bombers including     and  . KCNA said the test showed North Korea ”has all powerful means for retaliatory strike” should Washington take any military action to stop its nuclear weapons program.  Putin made the comments on the sidelines of the One Belt One Road summit in Beijing, a meeting of 29 heads of state convened by Chinese President Xi Jinping to push his vision for China’s global expansion. The Russian president called on all parties to ”find peaceful solutions.” Putin’s partial defense of North Korea came after White House press secretary Sean Spicer suggested that the missile test may provoke a more forceful response from the Kremlin.  In a White House statement released Sunday, Spicer said: ”With the missile impacting so close to Russian soil    in fact, closer to Russia than to Japan    the President cannot imagine that Russia is pleased.” The US and Russia also offered differing estimates for where the missile splashed down. The US said it terminated flight just 96 kilometers (60 miles) from the Russian port city of Vladivostock, whereas the Russian Defense Ministry said it landed 500 kilometers (311 miles) from its Pacific coast line.  Russia’s relations with North Korea  While Russia and North Korea don’t have strong trade ties, they are building on their economic relationship. New ferry services are running between the countries and Russia has given permission for some 50, 000 North Koreans to carry out manual work on projects in Russia. Russia is one of the few countries that has diplomatic relations with North Korea. Kim Jong Un’s father, Kim Jong Il, went to Moscow on a state visit during his rule in 2011, and Putin visited Pyongyang in 2000. ”While Russia is concerned about North Korea and its missiles, it also sees North Korea as an opportunity to gain leverage with the West, the US in particular,” said Matthew Chance, CNN’s Moscow correspondent.  ”Russia doesn’t want North Korea to have nuclear weapons, but the response from officials in Moscow has been minimal because they know Russia isn’t one of Pyongyang’s targets,” he added. UN Security Council condemns missile launches, The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) on Monday released a statement in which the members ”expressed their utmost concern over the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s highly destabilizing behavior and flagrant and provocative defiance” of the Security Council. ”The members of the Security Council agreed that the Security Council would continue to closely monitor the situation and take further significant measures including sanctions, in line with the Council’s previously expressed determination,” the statement added. Last month, Russia and China backed a United Nations Security Council resolution condemning a previous missile launch, demanding that it ”immediately” cease further actions that violate resolutions. Since US President Donald Trump took power in January, rhetoric has ramped up on both sides. Senior US officials made it clear early on that the Obama administration’s policy of ”strategic patience” on North Korea had failed. The Trump administration declared early on that the waiting was over, and followed through by deploying a US strike group, led by the aircraft carrier the USS Carl Vinson, to the waters off the Korean Peninsula. North Korea responded with threats and accusations. ”The US has recognized that direct military confrontation didn’t work all that well last time,” Carl Baker, Director of Programs at Pacific Forum CSIS in Honolulu, Hawaii, told CNN. ”It didn’t have the effect that they had desired, so they will let (further developments) play out in the UNSC.”"
313,Theresa May Is Poised to Be Britain’s Next Prime Minister - The New York Times,2016-08-12,"LONDON  —   Theresa May emerged on Monday as Britain’s next prime minister, becoming the second woman, after Margaret Thatcher, to hold that post. She faces multiple challenges as soon as she takes office, from negotiating the nation’s departure from the European Union to addressing deep social and political divisions to reviving a wounded economy. Her victory came on another day of rapid developments in British politics and set in motion a process that officials said would put her in 10 Downing Street by Wednesday night, succeeding David Cameron. Ms. May, until now Britain’s home secretary, is set to take over at a time of immense upheaval. The nation must not only negotiate its withdrawal from the European Union, a process fraught with economic and political risks, but it must also hold itself together amid a renewed clamor from Scotland for independence. Early signs are that Britain’s economy has already taken a substantial hit from the exit vote, or “Brexit. ” A Conservative like Mrs. Thatcher, who governed from 1979 to 1990, Ms. May, 59, has won a reputation for steeliness in her tenure as home secretary. She has pledged to negotiate a deal to leave the European Union that would reassert Britain’s ability to control immigration, a central issue in the referendum on June 23 on whether to leave the bloc. Yet unlike Mrs. Thatcher, Ms. May is seen as a relative moderate and on Monday she promised to address inequality, give workers greater representation on corporate boards and limit tax cuts. Ms. May said that she was “honored and humbled” to be chosen for the job, promised to get the best deal over Britain’s exit from the European Union, and vowed to create an economy that works not for the “privileged few,” but for all. The British referendum on June 23 plunged the European Union into crisis. It left Britain rudderless as the pound sank in value and both the governing and opposition parties engaged in fierce and acrimonious leadership battles. Mr. Cameron, who had supported remaining in the European Union, said after the referendum that he would resign once the governing Conservatives selected a new leader, a process that he had expected to last until September but that was drastically accelerated on Monday. After making a brief statement describing his successor as “strong” and “competent,” Mr. Cameron was caught on a microphone humming as he returned to his office. Mr. Cameron’s statement completed a day of high political drama in which Ms. May’s rival for the Conservative Party leadership, Andrea Leadsom, the energy minister, withdrew from the race. Leading party members quickly coalesced around Ms. May, insisting that the contest should not be reopened. A party committee agreed. Ms. Leadsom had already faced accusations  —   which she denied  —   of embellishing her curriculum vitae, but her campaign ran aground over the weekend after The Times of London published an interview in which she suggested that she was a better candidate because she is a mother, while Ms. May is not. Surrounded by supportive lawmakers, Ms. Leadsom on Monday made no reference to that issue, but said that she was quitting the contest and endorsing Ms. May, and that she hoped to see her installed as prime minister “as soon as possible. ” The turn of events meant that Ms. May would become prime minister without a general election and without completing the campaign she and Ms. Leadsom had been waging for the endorsement of the Conservative Party’s    members. Last week, the former Conservative cabinet minister Kenneth Clarke described Ms. May as a “bloody difficult woman,” noting that he had worked for another female politician of similar temperament, namely Mrs. Thatcher. Far from being insulted, Ms. May used the comment to suggest that her negotiating stance with European officials would be as tough as that of Mrs. Thatcher, who went into battle on the Continent, particularly over British financial contributions to the bloc. “Ken Clarke might have found me to be a ‘bloody difficult woman.’ The next person to find that out will be   Juncker,” she told fellow Conservative lawmakers, referring to the president of the European Commission, the bloc’s executive, ITV reported. But in a speech on Monday, Ms. May outlined an economic agenda unlike that of Mrs. Thatcher, calling for new mechanisms to curb executive pay and warning big multinational companies that they must pay their share of taxes. Ms. May has also been compared to Angela Merkel, the chancellor of Germany who, like Ms. May, is the daughter of a clergyman and is known for her   methodical and pragmatic approach. The   turmoil in Britain has also gripped the opposition Labour Party, prompting a challenge against its leader, Jeremy Corbyn, who has been accused of not campaigning hard enough against a British withdrawal from Europe. There were growing fears on Monday that the party might split because of the bitter dispute. Nevertheless, opposition politicians called for a general election and questioned Ms. May’s democratic mandate, since she will assume the job on the basis of an internal transfer of power within the governing party. So far, Ms. May has rejected the notion of a quick general election. Her top priority will be to frame a negotiating strategy for leaving the union, after the referendum in which she sided with those who wanted to remain. On Monday, Ms. May insisted that “Brexit means Brexit,” as she sought to reassure   that she was committed to the policy, adding that “there will be no attempt to remain inside the E. U. There will be no attempts to rejoin it by the back door, no second referendum. ” But, while 52 percent of voters supported Brexit, they did so for differing reasons, including reasserting national sovereignty and opposition to migration from within the bloc, which guarantees the right to live and work within any member nation. Ms. May is expected to take a tough stance on immigration in part because she is politically vulnerable on the issue. As home secretary, she failed to fulfill a Conservative pledge to control the number of people arriving in Britain. The numbers persistently exceeded targets and included arrivals of   which the government had the power to curb. Ms. May has signaled her intention to restrict migration from Europe, even if doing so hurt Britain’s position in negotiating a new trade deal with the bloc. She will also be under pressure from big business to secure the best possible access to Europe’s single market, which normally entails accepting the principle of free movement of workers across national frontiers. One important question for Ms. May is when to invoke Article 50 of the European Union’s governing treaty, which starts the withdrawal procedure. That effectively sets a   deadline for a deal to be struck. She has suggested that she intends to wait until her government has settled on its negotiating stance before invoking the article despite pressure from Europe’s leaders to act more quickly. On Monday she said more about her wider political agenda in a speech that offered plans to address some of the economic and social inequalities evident in Britain. Those include populist resentments thought to have motivated many   voters in economically depressed areas outside London and in the affluent southeast of England. “There is a growing divide between a more prosperous older generation and a struggling younger generation. And there is a gaping chasm between wealthy London and the rest of the country,” she said, positioning herself in a centrist tradition of “one nation” Conservatism. Speaking in Birmingham, England, Ms. May also called for efforts to increase productivity, for employees and consumers to gain seats on company boards and for votes on executive pay to become binding rather than advisory. Big multinationals should pay their share of taxes, she said, adding: “Whether you’re Amazon, Google or Starbucks, you have a duty to put something back, you have a debt to your fellow citizens, you have a responsibility to pay your taxes. ”"
314,A Casualty of ‘The Birth of a Nation’ Controversy Speaks Out - The New York Times,2016-12-08,"At Fox Searchlight’s holiday party in New York last week, the Bagger bumped into a couple of stars from two of the studio’s splashiest 2016 productions: one of the films soared to great heights, while the other crashed to an unimagined low. The first actor was Natalie Portman, who is raking in rave reviews for her performance in the title role in “Jackie” and is expecting her second child in a few months. The Bagger asked how she was faring on the awards circuit. “While pregnant and sober?” Ms. Portman dryly replied. The other actor was Colman Domingo, who played Hark in the slave revolt film “The Birth of a Nation,” which, for the first half of this year, before controversy engulfed it, was considered one of the brightest prospects for the awards season. He said now that the uproar had subsided, he wanted to share his frustrations and disappointments about how everything played out. “You walk into these rooms, and it’s almost like a bittersweet look people give you in their eyes,” Mr. Domingo said. “I look at the work of my peers on the film, and I wish it was being celebrated. The cinematography, the music. Aja Naomi King’s is one of the best performances of this year. But we’re under the veil of the whole controversy, and people almost don’t want to touch it. ” It is hard to overstate the ebullience that met “The Birth of a Nation” at its premiere at Sundance in January. “Birth,” which tells of the slave rebellion led by Nat Turner in 1831, was the passion project of its director, writer and star, Nate Parker, who spent eight years pulling the financing together. The film arrived in Park City, Utah, just as Hollywood was fielding intense scrutiny for its   roster of Oscar acting nominees, and after a bidding war “Birth” sold to Fox Searchlight for $17. 5 million, a festival record. There were projections of awards, and while other films featuring black protagonists  —   “Moonlight,” “Fences,” “Hidden Figures” and “Loving”  —   have come to dominate Oscar chatter, “Birth” was initially at the fore. “It felt like the film had an urgency,” Mr. Domingo said. Then, in the summer, after Oprah Winfrey and Spike Lee heartily endorsed the film, news articles emerged detailing harrowing rape accusations made in 1999 against Mr. Parker at Penn State, where he was a student and wrestler, and his roommate at the time, Jean McGianni Celestin (who would go on to share a story credit on the film). Mr. Parker was acquitted, and the case against the roommate, who was initially convicted, was reversed. After news broke that Mr. Parker’s accuser had killed herself in 2012, the scandal went nuclear. It all came to a head at the Toronto International Film Festival in September, when audiences responded to “Birth” with standing ovations. At a jammed news conference attended by every lead in the cast, including Mr. Domingo, Mr. Parker deflected a pointed question (asked by the Bagger). Few would doubt the importance of the film, the Bagger said, but people were having trouble separating the artist from the art. And since the film’s message was one of moral accountability, people felt Mr. Parker should offer his accuser’s family an apology. Would he now? Mr. Parker demurred, saying he was there to promote the film and celebrate the hundreds of people who made it. At that moment, Mr. Domingo, who had been sitting near Mr. Parker on the panel, said he felt the wind leave his sails. “That’s when I knew that the 45 minutes of the cast speaking in detail about the film would be eviscerated,” said Mr. Domingo, who is also a playwright and stars in television’s “Fear the Walking Dead. ” “I was disappointed,” he continued. “I would’ve handled it differently. Could he have handled it better? I don’t know what it’s like to walk in his shoes. I try to deal with things in a different way. I think I’m always trying to see the other’s point of view, dealing in a very    way. It’s    instead of   . But it’s possible he felt embattled by the time he got to Toronto. This was something he created with the spirit of love and community, and suddenly he’s battling other forces of something he dealt with 17 years ago. ” (Mr. Parker’s acquittal came in 2001.) Over all, Mr. Domingo believed that Mr. Parker, whom he described as “deeply passionate, generous and kind,” had handled the matter “the best way he can. ” Mr. Domingo also found fault with the Bagger’s question, a criticism others have echoed. “Looking back in hindsight, I can see Nate’s point of view. Why apologize when he was vindicated?” he asked. “But I believe with the media, you must answer every question in some way. And in very, very, touchy situations, we must answer every question again and again. Even if we’ve said it before, we have to say it again. ” His   shared his discomfort. Aunjanue Ellis, who played Nat Turner’s mother, wrote in Ebony that she “agonized” over how Mr. Parker handled the fallout from the accusations and that she grieved for the accuser and her family. Still, she urged people to see the film, as did the groundbreaking director Julie Dash, telling the Bagger, at the Toronto film festival: “No will always mean no. It will always be attached to that film. However, do not miss this experience of seeing that film. ” But people did miss seeing that film, in droves: according to Box Office Mojo, it has earned just $15. 8 million domestically. Its case was not helped by some middling reviews. But there is no question that the controversy dealt a death blow. (Mr. Parker’s representatives did not respond to questions for this article.) Looking back, Mr. Domingo said he felt there was “a huge takedown by any means necessary,” not just toward the film but also toward black resistance in America. After a summer, he said, of “dealing with black men on the streets and retaliation and Black Lives Matter, Blue Lives Matter, All Lives Matter, it’s almost as if this film was too powerful,” he said. “It was like a big slap on the hand: Never try this again. Who do you think you are? If this were ‘Madea’s Halloween,’ would they try to take it down? Absolutely not. ” While opinionators, including Damon Young of the digital magazine Very Smart Brothas, have dismissed the notion of a concerted takedown, it’s hard not to compare Mr. Parker’s scandal with that of Casey Affleck, the star of the current release “Manchester by the Sea. ” Mr. Affleck, who is white, faced sexual harassment complaints from two women  —   neither of whom would comment  —   and reached a settlement with them in 2010. Different circumstances, to be sure  —   “Birth” also prominently featured rapes, while “Manchester” is about a   family  —   but, still, the matter has not seemed to hurt Mr. Affleck’s Oscar chances this season. In the end, Mr. Domingo said, the controversy could be seen as a reflection of how he often sees his position in American culture. “I feel in many ways as a black man in this country, you should apologize, or feel gratitude,” he said. In recent days, Mr. Domingo said, he has discerned a shift around “Birth,” with more people being able to see it on its own merit. “This is one of the seminal moments in my career,” he said. “One of the moments I’m so proud of in every way. But you can’t feel proud of your work without the other feelings on top of it. ”"
315,NYPD detective apologizes for Uber tirade,2015-04-01,"New York (CNN) A New York Police Department detective apologized Friday for an angry exchange with an Uber driver that was caught on video and landed him on modified assignment.  ”I apologize. I sincerely apologize,” Patrick Cherry told WNBC’s Jonathan Dienst. Cherry, an NYPD detective assigned to the FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Force with   security clearance, faces suspension, reassignment or loss of his clearance after the video of the altercation went viral. ”I was just angry, at that moment, for that exchange.” Cherry said. ”If the conversation initially went differently, we probably would have shook hands at the end of that encounter.” The altercation began Monday when the Uber driver gestured to a detective in an unmarked car to use his blinker after he was allegedly attempting to park without using it, according to Sanjay Seth, a passenger in the car who uploaded the video to YouTube. The video picks up seconds after the detective began yelling at the driver and mocking his accent, and also shows the unmarked car with lights flashing pulled over behind the Uber car. In the video, the detective tells the driver he has committed ”three traffic and law violations”  and then becomes irate and uses expletives toward the comparably calm driver. A visibly upset Police Commissioner William Bratton on Wednesday said the detective was placed on modified assignment pending an investigation. ”No good cop can watch that without a wince,” he told reporters. ”As all good cops know . .. the officer made their jobs a little bit harder. That kind of anger like that is unacceptable in any encounter discourtesy like that and language like that is unacceptable. That officer’s behavior reflected poorly on everyone who wears our uniform.” Cherry also apologized to the police commissioner, saying ”he’s doing a lot of good work to strengthen community relations in the city and I set that back. I would work, personally work to fix that.” ”You can’t judge three minutes of a tape involving me and me alone as indication that that’s the kind of practice of the New York City Police Department,” he added. Bratton, who said the detective was on duty at the time, issued an apology to the driver and passengers.   Mayor Bill de Blasio told reporters at an unrelated news conference that he had not seen the video. ”There’s just no place for any public servant to use discriminatory or negative language,” he said. ”Obviously, our police play a particularly sensitive role and need to show respect for all people.”  In a statement, Michael Palladino, president of the Detectives’ Endowment Association, called the officer ”a person of good character and an excellent detective” who ”should not be judged by one isolated incident.” ”I am not trying to minimize the significance of what occurred,” Palladino said. ”I am simply pointing out that cops are just like everyone else. They have families, friends and other things going on in their lives, too, that may affect their behavior at times. There is no disputing that we are held to a higher standard, that is why this incident is so newsworthy.” In the video, after the detective steps back to his car, the Uber driver, who moved to America less than two years ago, turns to the passenger and thanks him for recording the video. ”That’s crazy. That’s really inappropriate,” the passenger tells the driver. ”Listen, it’s not your fault. He shouldn’t be slamming your car door, throwing things around. He doesn’t have a right to open your door.” When the detective comes back, he is irate and doesn’t allow the driver to speak. ”I don’t care what you have to say, people are allowed to park their cars on the side of the street without your interference,” the detective tells the driver. ”I don’t know where you’re coming from, where you think it’s appropriate in doing that. That’s the way it works.” ”I’ve got news for you,” the detective says, ”the only reason you’re not in handcuffs and going to jail and getting summons in the precinct is because I have things to do. That’s the only reason that’s not happening. Because this isn’t important enough for me. You’re not important enough. Don’t ever do that again.” The NYPD said the Internal Affairs Bureau is investigating the incident. ”The behavior in the video is wrong and unacceptable and we appreciate the NYPD investigating the incident. We are in touch with our   who was subjected to this terrible experience and will continue to provide any support he needs,” Uber said Tuesday. Seth met Wednesday with an investigator from the Civilian Complaint Review Board, according to board spokeswoman Linda Sachs.  The investigator is attempting to interview the driver as well as the police officer.  The findings will be presented to the board, which will make an official determination on whether misconduct was committed, Sachs said. The board will either refer the decision to the NYPD with a disciplinary recommendation, or decide to bring up the officer on administrative charges, with the decision presented to the police commissioner."
316,Sanders: ’The Model of Democratic Party Is Failing’ - Breitbart,2017-04-23,"Sunday on CBS’s “Face the Nation,” Sen Bernie Sanders ( ) declared the model of the Democratic Party was failing and pointed to Republican dominance in not just Congress, but in the states as well.  Sanders said, “Well, I think what is clear to anyone who looks at where the Democratic Party today is, that the model of the Democratic Party is failing. We have a Republican president who ran as a candidate as the most unpopular candidate in modern history of this country. Republicans control the House, the Senate,   of governor’s chairs and in the last eight years they have picked up 900 legislative seats. Clearly, the Democratic Party has to change. ” “And in my view what it has to become is a grassroots party, a party which makes decisions from the bottom on up, a party which is more dependent on small donations than large donations, a party, john, that speaks to the pain of the working class in this country. The middle class is shrinking. 43 million people living in poverty,” he continued. “Almost all new income and wealth is going to the top 1%. People can’t afford to send their kids to college. They can’t afford childcare. They can’t afford health care. The Democratic Party has to take the lead, rallying young people, working people, stand up to the billionaire class, and when we do that, you’re going to see voter turnout swell. You’re going to see people coming in and running for office. You’re going to see Democrats regain control of the United States Congress. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN"
317,"Meet the man behind Right Side Broadcasting, the network that live-streams every Donald Trump speech",2016-09-19,"’  ’ ”   Joe Seales was a    dad between jobs. Then he started   watching Donald Trump’s speeches. ” ’   Seales is the CEO of Right Side Broadcasting Network, a website   known best for its YouTube channel, which has hosted feeds   of almost every single Trump rally, town hall, or public   appearance since July 2015. ’ ”   With broadcasting experience working with   figures   like Glenn Beck, the RSBN CEO and business partner Adam Taxin, a   former reporter, decided they could easily broadcast Trump   events, which were getting    coverage on cable   networks, but were difficult to find online. They flew to Phoenix   on July 11 for Trump’s rally, turned on the livestream,   and immediately found an audience. ” ’   ”We covered that speech and did that live, we got a million views   on that speech within the first few months,” Seales told Business   Insider during an interview in September. ”That’s when I knew:   ’’Let’s run with this. ’’” ’ ’   Right Side Broadcasting Network has emerged as a tool for many   Trump fans, journalists, and campaign operatives. ’ ’The Trump campaign is blatant about its support   for the network, tweeting out links, while even Clinton campaign   staffers admit privately that they watch the feeds of speeches on   RSBN out of convenience. ’ ”   The formula for the organization’s success is simple. The   cable networks often carried Trump’s speeches, which eschewed   policy detail and rote stump speech regurgitation for      zingers and audience participation. But Seales   recognized that while the networks chopped up the speeches and   posted bits on social media for news   value, ” ’  ’ ”   RSBN has over 186, 000 subscribers on YouTube. MSNBC, by   comparison, has 173, 000 subscribers. RSBN’s most popular   video  —   a clip of Secret Service agents surrounding Trump when a   fan tried to charge the stage  —   has over 2. 3 million views, while   several videos of entire Trump events have over a million views. ” ’   Though Seales said he initially funded the operation out of   pocket, he told Business Insider that RSBN is now completely     with an average of ”roughly” $  donation.   The RSBN website specifically touts the channel’’s status as a     operation. ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ”   RSBN doesn’t have the cash to afford a satellite truck, and   instead negotiates with venues and advanced staff in order to get   a hardwire internet connection to broadcast its streams. Its blog   is primarily populated with links to Trump   and   posts directly from   site Breitbart News. ” ’  ’ ’   Still, Seales has big plans for the operation. ’ ’   Over the next several months, RSBN wants to roll out additional   shows on their YouTube channel with the eventual goal of moving   toward a  ’ ’   Earlier last summer, Seales signed deals with conservative media   personalities Wayne Dupree and Pastor Mark Burns, who   independently reached out to the RSBN chief about simulcasting   shows on the network. Dupree approached RSBN in June about   starting a show. After several shows, Burns reached out to the   channel interested in launching his own show. ’ ’   Burns was a natural fit for the channel. A pastor with a   tiny worship center in South Carolina, Burns gained notoriety for   his televangelism, and was  by former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski   last fall, garnering a spot introducing Trump at his   rallies. His   were so popular that RSBN began   posting clips of just the Burns intros. ’ ’  ’ ’   But growing from a skeleton crew broadcasting speeches to a   legitimate media organization has also presented obvious   challenges. ’ ’   It’’s unclear that the simulcasts with RSBN’’s personalities, for   one, are particularly popular outside of a core group of RSBN   viewers. Dupree’’s shows generally garner far less views than   livestreams from rallies or even any of the      reporting that RSBN dubs ”.” ’ ’   And earlier this month, Burns was forced to apologize for   exaggerating his credentials  revealed that the pastor had lied   about being a part of a fraternity and serving in the US Army   Reserves. ’ ”   RSBN defended Burns on its website, saying that the   pastor’s fabrications were mistakes like those anyone else would   make. ” ’   ”Pastor Burns, we still love you, bro,” Seales . ’ ”   Burns did not respond to Business Insider’s repeated request for   comment for this article. ” ”   The   nature of the feed also attracts some of the     magnate’s uglier followers. RSBN streams often fill   up with comments on the sidebar, which often   includes racially, religiously, and sexually charged   language. Seales said he recognizes criticism of   the RSBN comments feed, and told Business Insider he pays   staffers to comb back through comments, and block users posting   offensive material. ” ’   With less than two months until the election, Seales is starting   to play for a future he did not envision a year ago. ’ ’   ”Our goal is to be relevant after the election when there   are no more Trump speeches,” Seales said. ’ ’   Still, Seals acknowledged that ” The network plans to open an office in DC if   Trump is elected, and will attempt to get White House Press Corps   credentials. ’ ’   A Clinton win could present more challenges. ’ ’    ”I ’"
318,Executive Gun Control: Five Seniors Obama Might Have Disarmed,2016-01-05,"On January 4 —  the day before President Obama announced his executive gun control to the nation —  the White House released an executive order fact sheet showing that a gun ban for some Social Security beneficiaries was being brought under the auspices of Obama’s executive action. [This particular gun ban immediately brings to mind the frequency with which grandmas and grandpas use guns to defend themselves and their families and forces the reader to consider what the plight of such seniors might be if Obama took away their guns.  What would have happened to these five seniors if Obama had taken away their guns? 1. On April 21,    Jewell Turner was sitting in her truck in Fort Worth, Texas, when a man walked up and stuck a knife to her throat. She was able to convince him to change his mind by sticking a gun in his face and telling him to “back off. ” 2. On May 15,    Robert Dietz walked outside to check on his surveillance cameras after they had “gone dark. ” According to KHOU. com, Dietz then “found a man rummaging through a storage trailer he keeps parked under his carport. ” The suspect hit Dietz in the head with a gas can, so Dietz opened fire, shooting the suspect in the stomach. 3. On September 2,    Harvey Lembo grew tired of the frequent robberies of his   apartment and bought a gun for  . The Portland Press Herald reports that Lembo is confined to a wheel chair and felt defenseless in the face of the robberies. Lembo said his place has been robbed “five or six times” over the past few years, including a robbery in August 2015 in which the robber took his prescription pain pills and money. When a robber entered on the night of September 2, Lembo grabbed his newly purchased gun, wheeled his chair around to face the robber, and held him at gunpoint without incident until the robber tried to escape. Once the attempt at escape was made, Lembo shot the suspect, wounding him. 4. On September 21, an alleged   entered an Indianapolis home and pointed a gun at the head of an elderly woman, only to be shot numerous times by her husband. The suspect had entered the home believing the woman was alone, but the husband was in the back of the house and responded with a gun in his hand when he heard his wife under assault. 5. On September 22, an elderly homeowner in Phoenix, Arizona, had to use a gun for   after a suspect repeatedly tried to enter his home in broad daylight. According to CBS 5, the elderly homeowner was alone when he saw the suspect in his backyard. The homeowner grabbed a gun and met the suspect as he was allegedly attempting to enter through a window.  The homeowner said he warned the suspect that he was armed, but the suspect allegedly continued trying to enter. The homeowner then opened fire, striking him at least once. The police said, “The homeowner reported perceiving a threat and fired at the subject, striking him. ” Where would these elderly people and their families be right now if Obama had taken away their guns?

320,The planet you’ve probably never heard of,2015-02-20," (CNN) Way out beyond Mars, but before you get to Jupiter, is a planet.  You read that right. There’s a planet between Mars and Jupiter.  You may not have heard of it, but it was discovered in 1801    129 years before Pluto. It originally was called a planet, then later an asteroid and now it’s called a dwarf planet. Its name is Ceres (pronounced like series) and you’ll likely be hearing a lot more about it in the coming weeks. Ceres is one of five named dwarf planets recognized by NASA and the International Astronomical Union (IAU). The other four are Eris, Pluto, Makemake and Haumea.  But Ceres is the first of these worlds to get a visitor from Earth: NASA’s Dawn spacecraft is arriving on March 6.  ”Ceres is a ’planet’ that you’ve probably never heard of,” said Robert Mase, Dawn project manager at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. Ceres may be considered a dwarf planet, but it’s ”the giant of the main asteroid belt,” Dr. Marc Rayman, chief engineer and mission director of the Dawn mission, told CNN. ”It is not only the largest object between Mars and Jupiter, it is the largest object between the sun and Pluto that a spacecraft has not yet visited.” ”We are tremendously excited,” Rayman said. ”We have guided this robotic probe for well over seven years on an interplanetary journey of more than 3 billion miles. Along the way we sailed past Mars. We spent 14 months orbiting and scrutinizing the giant protoplanet Vesta. . .. Now, finally, we are on the verge of conducting the first exploration ever of the first dwarf planet.” Images taken on February 19 when Dawn was about 29, 000 miles (46, 000 kilometers) from Ceres show a bright spot on Ceres and a dimmer companion amid the small world’s cratered surface. NASA says both spots appear to be in the same basin.  The images are puzzling to scientists and they say they’ll have to wait until Dawn gets even closer to sort out the cause.  ”We we will have to wait for better resolution before we can make such geologic interpretations,” said Chris Russell, principal investigator for the Dawn mission, based at the University of California, Los Angeles.   Rayman said Ceres’ surface is pretty beaten up and that its craters are ”scars from life in the rough and tumble asteroid belt.”  Why study a   space rock? Rayman said because it’s a survivor    and a mysterious one. Made up of rock and ice, Ceres may even have liquid water deep beneath its surface    ”perhaps as ponds or lakes or even oceans,” Rayman said. He said Ceres ”appears to have been in the process of growing to become a   planet when Jupiter terminated its growth nearly 4. 6 billion years ago.”   So by studying Ceres, scientists learn more about how the rest of the solar system formed. And he said, we should study Ceres because it’s there    and we need to understand the universe we live in. ”We should study it because we hunger for knowledge and understanding. Grand undertakings like this nurture our spirit,” Rayman said. Rayman said that if you had learned about the solar system 200 years ago, ”you would have learned that Ceres was a planet, just as people who learned about the solar system in more recent generations learned that Pluto is.” Speaking of Pluto, the most famous of the dwarf planets gets its own visitor in July. The New Horizons spacecraft is closing in for a flyby of Pluto and its moons. This talk of planets and dwarf planets is still a little confusing, so here’s the most recent tally: NASA currently recognizes eight planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, and the five named dwarf planets we listed earlier.  But a sixth possible dwarf planet already is on NASA’s watch list. Called 2012 VP113, it’s believed to be one of the most distant objects in our solar system. On its Solar System Exploration website, NASA says the object was nicknamed ”Biden” after Vice President Joseph Biden because of the VP in its initial designation. It will be up to the IAU to decide whether i2012 VP113 is a dwarf planet and whether it gets an official name. But expect the numbers for planets in our solar system to keep changing. Mike Brown, the CalTech astronomy professor who helped discover dwarf planet Eris and who takes responsibility for killing off Pluto as a   planet, has his own tally listing more than 360 possible dwarf planets. And NASA has said there may be many more dwarf planets that we haven’t found yet.  So Ceres, and its cousins, may soon outnumber the traditional planets you learned about in grade school."

322,Michelle Fields: In Her Own Words - Breitbart,2016-03-10,"I never sought to be part of the story. [On Tuesday night, I went to cover Donald Trump’s press conference at the Trump National Golf Club in Jupiter, Florida. I was looking to cover the event like I have covered many live political events for Breitbart News, including an uneventful Trump press conference in Palm Beach the week before.  Addressing the gathered reporters and the nation at large, Trump was in an especially jovial mood Tuesday night. The networks just declared he had won the Mississippi Republican primary and, during his speech, that he won Michigan Republican primary as well. I wasn’t called upon to ask a question during the televised press conference, but afterwards Trump wandered around, stopping at every reporter to take their questions. When he approached me, I asked him about his view on an aspect of affirmative action.  Trump acknowledged the question, but before he could answer I was jolted backwards. Someone had grabbed me tightly by the arm and yanked me down. I almost fell to the ground, but was able to maintain my balance. Nonetheless, I was shaken.  The Washington Post’s Ben Terris immediately remarked that it was Trump’s campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, who aggressively tried to pull me to the ground. I quickly turned around and saw Lewandowski and Trump exiting the building together. No apology. No explanation for why he did this.   Even if Trump was done taking questions, Lewandowski would be out of line. Campaign managers aren’t supposed to try to forcefully throw reporters to the ground, no matter the circumstance. But what made this especially jarring is that there was no hint Trump was done taking questions. No one was pushing him to get away. He seemed to have been happily answering queries from my fellow reporters just a moment before.   Many people have been asking me on Twitter and in emails what exactly happened Tuesday night. I hope this article answers those questions and I can get back to reporting the news, not being a part of it. "
323,David Duke running for Senate seat in Louisiana,2016-07-22,"Washington (CNN) Former Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard David Duke announced his US Senate campaign Friday in Louisiana, promising to defend the rights of European Americans. ”Thousands of special interest groups stand up for   Mexican Americans, Jewish Americans, etc. ,” he said in a YouTube video. ”The fact is that European Americans need at least one man in the United States, one man in Congress, who will defend their rights and heritage.” Duke, a former Republican state representative and convicted felon, said his emphasis on the rights of European Americans is what distinguishes him. ”I believe in equal rights for all and respect for all Americans. However what makes me different is I also demand respect for the rights and the heritage of European Americans,” he said.  Republican Sen. David Vitter announced last year that he would not run for office again when his term was up at the end of this year.  ”We must stop the massive immigration and ethnic cleansing of the people whose forefathers created America,” Duke said in the message. The former hate group leader said he popularized the ”America First” slogan that Republican nominee Donald Trump has now embraced. ”I was the first major candidate in modern times to promote the term and policy of ”America First.” We can not have free trade without fair trade we must protect American jobs and businesses,” said Duke, who also said he is ”overjoyed” by Trump’s campaign. Duke, who previously praised Trump’s candidacy, said he’s ”overjoyed” by Trump’s campaign. ”The New York Times admitted that my platform became the GOP mainstream and propelled Republican control of Congress,” he said. ”I’m overjoyed to see Donald Trump and most Americans embrace most of the issues that I’ve championed for years. My slogan remains ’America First. ’”  Trump disavowed Duke in March after failing to do so when asked about the hate group leader’s support on CNN. The uproar started when Trump was asked by CNN’s Jake Tapper on ”State of the Union” if he would disavow Duke and other white supremacist groups supporting his campaign. ”Just so you understand, I don’t know anything about David Duke, OK?” Trump responded. The next day, Trump blamed a ”bad earpiece” during an appearance on NBC’s ”Today.”  On Friday, Trump campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks said Trump ”has disavowed David Duke and will continue to do so.” The National Republican Senatorial Committee leadership said Friday that they will not back Duke’s run ”under any circumstance.” ”Louisiana voters will be able to choose from several Republican Senate candidates who will have a great impact on the Bayou State and the future of our country. David Duke is not one of them,” the group’s executive director Ward Baker said in a statement. ”He will not have the support of the NRSC under any circumstance.” And on Saturday, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus condemned Duke, tweeting, ”David Duke  his hateful bigotry have no place in the Republican Party  the RNC will never support his candidacy under any circumstance.” Other Republicans running for the seat include Rep. John Fleming, Rep. Charles Boustany, Jr. Retired Colonel Rob Maness, former Rep. Joseph Cao, State Treasurer John Kennedy and Abhay Patel. The Republican Party of Louisiana said Duke history of ”hate” causes them to oppose his candidacy. ”David Duke’s history of hate marks a dark stain on Louisiana’s past and has no place in our current conversation,” the group said in a statement. ”The Republican Party of Louisiana will play an active role in opposing David Duke’s candidacy.” CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story incorrectly described David Duke’s political career. He was a state representative. "

325,Duterte Tells Civilians to Take Arms Against Islamic State Affiliate After Soldier Beheading - Breitbart,2017-04-25,"Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has ordered an extended military operation against the Islamic State affiliate Abu Sayyaf and assured civilians that any violent action they take to subdue local terrorists will be forgiven in a court of law, following the arrest of a policewoman with ties to the group and the beheading of a soldier. [Abu Sayyaf, which has been active for years in the southern Philippines but more recently pledged allegiance to Islamic State caliph Abu Bakr   has become active in southern Bohol Island, a new territory for them. Duterte’s administration has responded with a reinforced military presence in the region, while Duterte himself has threatened to cannibalize the jihadists.  “I can eat you,” Duterte said this week. “Just give me salt and vinegar. True. Make me mad. Get me a terrorist. Give me salt and vinegar. I will eat his liver. ” In September, Duterte made a similar promise to “eat” Abu Sayyaf terrorists, following a series of attacks on soldiers. Duterte also assured civilians living in affected regions that he would endeavor to protect their right to  . Speaking last week following an attack on soldiers in Bohol, Duterte said, “to the police  …     and even civilians interested to fight and kill, the order is dead or alive. ” “I intend to also arm the civilians and I will include the civilians  …     you don’t have to worry,” he said. “Just go to the police and make a report and state your truth  …     no problem. I’ll take care of you, I’ll pardon you, whatever. ” Duterte has taken a similar stand with drug criminals, assuring civilians of impunity if they kill drug offenders. In addition to the increasingly common clashes between Abu Sayyaf terrorists and police, law enforcement arrested a Philippine policewoman this week for ties to the group. Philippine National Police (PNP) Superintendent Maria Cristina Nobleza is under arrest after police found evidence that she had been engaged in an affair with an Abu Sayyaf bombmaker, potentially handing over sensitive information. The investigation into whether she was a source for the terrorist group is ongoing. Authorities also found the head of Sergeant Anni Siraji, a Philippine soldier abducted on April 20 by the terrorist group. Abu Sayyaf terrorists reportedly beheaded him this weekend after the soldier was assigned to work as an intermediary between the terrorists and police. “He is involved in peace efforts,” Brigadier General Cirilito Sobejana told reporters. “He is not actually a combatant. We are using him to engage stakeholders because he is a Tausug [like most Abu Sayyaf],” he added, referring to the man’s ethnicity. Dutertespokesman Ernesto Abella called the beheading a “barbaric act” over the weekend and vowed more military action. “The President is firm and decisive in the fight against terrorism,” he said. “He has ordered government troops to carry out sustained, focused and intense operations to put an end to lawless and gruesome acts of violence. ” The Philippine Star quotes another PNP official as stating, “[Our] teams will do nothing except to ‘eat Abu Sayyaf in breakfast, lunch and dinner. ’” Duterte, who had repeatedly demanded the United States stay out of Philippine matters during the Obama administration, recently changed his disposition, requesting that American soldiers help his country fight the jihadist insurgency in the south. “As we fought together to stay above the enemy then, so we should help each other to address the threats that confront our societies, our region, and our world,” Duterte said in April, reaching out to President Donald Trump, according to regional outlet   News."
326,Trump Organization Moves to Avoid Possible Conflicts of Interest - The New York Times,2017-04-13,"In its latest effort to defuse a major public relations problem that might have loomed over Donald J. Trump’s presidency, the Trump Organization on Wednesday announced union accords at two major hotel holdings. The agreements resolve labor disputes that could have posed a conflict of interest for the   and come on the heels of other similar moves in recent weeks. In November, Mr. Trump paid $25 million to settle a number of lawsuits surrounding fraud allegations at Trump University, his former   education business, and this month the Trump Organization extricated itself from the management of a hotel project in Brazil, where the authorities were investigating allegations of corruption. Taken together, the moves suggest that Mr. Trump is sensitive to at least the perception that his business dealings could cast a shadow over his presidency, even if he has yet to detail how he might seek a more comprehensive solution to potential conflicts, such as outright divestment. “On the one hand, I think it’s important to acknowledge that this is meaningful, it does matter,” Danielle Brian, the executive director of the Project on Government Oversight, a nonpartisan ethics watchdog group, said of Wednesday’s agreements. “However, this piecemeal approach to dealing with conflicts is not going to deal with the bigger looming problem. ” The agreements also provide insight into Mr. Trump’s views on workers and labor unions. In contrast to the deal he helped broker at the Carrier plant in Indiana, which recently agreed to preserve about 850 jobs that it had planned to shift to Mexico, and which Mr. Trump was on hand to announce in person, the announcement of Wednesday’s deals came by way of a news release featuring statements from the Trump Organization and affiliates of the unions involved. The Trump transition team offered no comment and released no statement. One of the two labor agreements provides a union contract to workers at the Trump International Hotel Las Vegas, whose union the hotel had previously refused to bargain with. The second agreement eases a hurdle to unionization at a recently opened Trump hotel in Washington. The agreements reduce the probability that the National Labor Relations Board, which protects the labor rights of   employees, will be called on to adjudicate disputes between workers and the Trump Organization. That possibility raised the prospect of a conflict of interest if Mr. Trump were to retain a stake in his business. As president, Mr. Trump will eventually nominate all five members of the labor board, as well as its general counsel, who typically has the final say on whether to issue formal complaints against employers. The speed of the negotiations at the hotel in Las Vegas suggested that Mr. Trump was eager to put the issue behind him before his inauguration in January, after the hotel resisted workers’ efforts to unionize there for most of the past year and a half. The hotel hired consultants who spoke with employees at mandatory meetings about the risks of unionizing, according to earlier statements from the union. In charges filed with the labor board, some workers alleged that they had been fired or suspended from their jobs because of their unionization efforts. After the successful union election last December, the hotel appealed within the labor board structure, arguing that workers had been intimidated into voting for the union. When the full board rejected its final appeal last month, the hotel appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Bethany Khan, a union representative, said the new labor agreement had come together over a few days of negotiation last week and been ratified by union members over the weekend. Under the accord, the workers will join locals for culinary workers and bartenders that are affiliated with Unite Here, a prominent national union that represents hotel workers. The two sides agreed to a contract beginning Jan. 1 and running through May 31, 2021, which follows a relatively standard template for hotels in Las Vegas by providing annual wage increases, pension and health benefits, and job protections. Under the second accord, the Trump International Hotel Washington D. C. agreed to remain neutral as workers seek to unionize under a   agreement, enabling workers to simply sign authorization cards indicating that they want to unionize. The hotel will recognize the union if a majority of workers sign cards. The alternative, a   election, typically occurs when the employer opposes the unionization effort, as was the case at the Las Vegas property. In a statement referring to the agreement in Washington, Eric Danziger, the chief executive of Trump Hotels, said, “We share mutual goals with the union, as we both desire to ensure outstanding jobs for the employees, while also enabling the hotel to operate successfully in a competitive environment. ” Wednesday’s agreements do not eliminate the potential for conflicts of interest involving Mr. Trump and the labor board. The board’s general counsel, whose replacement Mr. Trump will probably appoint next year, will be in a position to decide whether to issue complaints about allegations of labor rights violations, but could also leave the decision to career civil servants. Such allegations could include refusing to bargain with the union in the future, or firing or disciplining union stewards for sticking up for fellow members under procedures outlined in the contract. The decision on issuing a complaint is in some sense the critical step of the labor board process. There are typically 20, 000 to 25, 000 charges of unfair labor practices in a given year, of which only a fraction result in a complaint  —   about 1, 270 last year  —   although some are settled beforehand. Any complaint issued by a regional director or the general counsel could then come before the board, at least some of whose members are likely to have been appointed by Mr. Trump. But if the general counsel declines to issue a complaint, the charge is effectively dead and generally cannot be appealed. “It’s the gateway into litigation,” said Wilma Liebman, a former labor board chairman. There remains an open charge of unfair labor practices against the Trump Organization, which was filed on behalf of a worker advocacy group in September over the contract that employees of the Trump presidential campaign were required to sign. The group alleged the contract’s noncompete and confidentiality clauses illegally discouraged employees from exercising their labor rights. Mr. Trump and his organization faced a potentially punishing calculus in deciding to bargain with the union in Las Vegas, aside from the issues of conflict of interest. Even if the Trump hotel in Las Vegas had prevailed in its efforts to undo the union election in federal court, which was probably a long shot in itself, the culinary workers would probably have continued their unionization campaign, creating a lingering source of embarrassment for the  . In September, workers at the Boulder Station casino in Las Vegas  —   owned by a company controlled by Frank and Lorenzo Fertitta, who until recently operated the Ultimate Fighting Championship, a mixed martial arts promoter  —   voted to unionize after a dogged campaign by the union that lasted more than six years. The campaign included the creation of a website highlighting the   tirades of the president of the U. F. C. and an effort by union affiliates in New York State to fight the league’s attempts to overturn a law banning the sport there. “They fight really hard,” said C. Jeffrey Waddoups, an economist at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, who studies union bargaining in the hotel and gambling industry. “It would draw a lot of attention. ”"
327,"Trump Responds to Michelle Obama, Slams ‘Demented’ Paul Krugman at Alabama ‘Thank You’ Tour Finale - Breitbart",2016-12-17,"MOBILE, Alabama  —   Despite    rain,   Donald Trump returned to   Stadium Saturday, declaring Mobile the place “where it all” began. [Indeed, 485 days ago, Trump hosted his first major rally of the cycle at  . This time, the former candidate returned to offer his thanks and take a victory lap before a crowd of some 15, 000 supporters.  Trump deviated from his usual rally walkout music, Lee Greenwood’s “Proud to Be an American,” for Lynyrd Skynyrd’s “Sweet Home Alabama. ” The   recalled his first   event, specifically the large crowd he was able to muster. “It was packed and incredible,” Trump said. “People said something is going on there. That was the beginning. And you remember, even though you do not have to vote for me, maybe in four years we will take a look. But you know what, I said I was coming back to see you in Alabama. ” Saturday’s event was Trump’s last stop on his “Thank You” tour  —   a series of rallies he launched shortly after winning last month’s presidential election. “I just want to thank the people of Alabama and I want to start by wishing you a very merry Christmas,” he said. “Merry Christmas. But I am here today for one reason, and that is to thank the incredible people. I recognize them, so many from Alabama. I want to thank the people of Alabama. We are really the people that love this country. ” Trump’s decision to host his final rally in Mobile was noteworthy  —   all of the  ’s previous stops on the   tour were in swing states. Alabama, however, is solidly Republican and has not gone for a Democrat since the 1976 presidential election between   Gov. Jimmy Carter and incumbent President Gerald Ford. Trump remained on message for much of the rally  —   offering praise for the military, vowing to build the border wall, cutting back on wasteful spending by specifically naming the Air Force One project, reforming the tax code, stressing his mission to create jobs, emphasizing “fair trade,” and punching back at political correctness. “I get this ‘person of the year’ from the Financial Times and from Time magazine this week,” he said. “So which is better  —   now remember women, because if it is a woman that gets it, we have to think about that. So they do it because they want to be politically correct. You run the magazine, you run the Financial Times or you run Time magazine, do you go ‘man of the year’   …     or do you go ‘person of the year?’ We’ll do ‘person’ first. Which is better? Person of the year? Or man of the year? It is pretty simple. If it is a woman, you go woman of the year, right?. ” Mobile is also the hometown of Sen. Jeff Sessions ( ) one of Trump’s early supporters and the  ’s pick for U. S. Attorney General. Midway through his speech, Trump introduced Sessions  —   among the most popular politicians in the state  —   to thunderous applause.  “What a great honor it is to have you back in my hometown  —   Mobile, Alabama,” Sessions said. “I do remember that event 16 months ago. How many of you were here on that day? It was an   event for the entire world and the United States political establishment. ” Trump also responded to first lady Michelle Obama’s remarks given in an interview with Oprah Winfrey, in  which she said she and her husband were “feeling what not having hope feels like,” given the results of the election. “Michelle Obama said yesterday that there is no hope,” Trump said to boos. “But I assume she was talking about the past and not the future. I’m telling you that we have tremendous hope. We have tremendous promise and we have tremendous potential. We are going to be so successful as a country again. We are going to be amazing. ” According to Trump, Mrs. Obama did not really mean what she said. “I honestly believe she meant that statement in a different way than in the way that came out, because I believe that there is tremendous hope. And beyond hope, we have such potential. This country has such potential. You watch, it will be so special. Things are going to happen like you haven’t seen in many, many decades. ” The   also took his obligatory shots at the “dishonest” media, calling them out for being wrong about the election outcome and for their reluctance to show the size of the crowds at his rallies. One member of the media he called out in particular was The New York Times’ Paul Krugman who, suggested yesterday that Trump was hoping for a    terrorist attack to boost his popularity, Thought: There was (rightly) a cloud of illegitimacy over Bush, dispelled (wrongly) by  . Creates some interesting incentives for Trump,  —   Paul Krugman (@paulkrugman) December 16, 2016,  He did not refer to Krugman by name, but suggested the Times columnist was “demented. ” “They said that I wanted to have another catastrophe like that because it is good for my base,” Trump said. “Anybody that says that  —   this guy is demented. He is a demented person. That is why the Times is failing. ” Other local Republicans made appearances at Saturday’s rally, including Rep. Bradley Byrne ( ) Alabama Republican chairwoman Terry Lathan, and Alabama Attorney General Luther Strange. Christian evangelist Franklin Graham and campaign staffers Cliff Sims, Stephen Miller, and Kellyanne Conway also spoke. Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor"
328,Deadly attacks in Germany have targeted public life,2016-12-20," (CNN) Over the course of 2016 there have been a string of terror attacks and foiled terror plots in Germany.  On Monday evening a large truck plowed into a Christmas market in Berlin filled with shoppers    authorities are treating it as a terror attack.  The market was a quintessential Christmas scene: trees strung with lights, vendors serving candied fruit and waffles, the smell of mulled wine in the air. But it’s far from the only corner of public life that’s been hit this year    train passengers and music festival goers have also been targeted. January: Train station terror plot, Two train stations in Munich were evacuated and train services stopped as Germany celebrated the beginning of 2016 after police received ”concrete information” of potential terror attacks.  Intelligence officials said the foiled attack was to involve multiple suicide bombers and was linked to ISIS. Between five and seven alleged terrorists were planning suicide attacks, Munich police president Hubertus Andra told reporters.  A huge manhunt was launched for the suspects but came up empty. The investigation was dropped for a lack of leads in February, according to the German Press Agency.  July: Train ax attack, In July, a    boy attacked passengers on a train in southern Germany with a knife and ax. Four people were injured, all of them family members and tourists from Hong Kong.  The suspect, a Pakistani citizen who came to Germany about a year before the attack, was later shot dead by police.  A video he left behind seemed to indicate that he was inspired by ISIS into carrying out a ”lone wolf” attack but did not have any links with the terror group. Police said it was likely he was radicalized in Germany.  July: Festival suicide bombing, Days after the train attack, a suicide bomber injured 15 people when he blew himself up at a music festival in Ansbach.  In a video left on his mobile phone, the    failed Syrian asylum seeker pledged allegiance to ISIS leader Abu Bakr   and ISIS media organizations claimed him as a ”soldier” of the caliphate.  The attack, which happened in the wake of the train stabbings and the devastating truck attack in Nice, France, spurred increased criticism from the right of Angela Merkel and German immigration and refugee policies.  December: Christmas market truck attack, The Nice attack was echoed this week as a large black truck hauling   of steel smashed into a crowded Christmas market Monday, killing at least 12 people and injuring dozens.  Berlin police said the truck was ”steered deliberately into the crowd” and are investigating it as a terror attack.  The driver of the truck has been arrested."
329,Donald Trump’s New Hampshire Lead Falls to 10% in Latest Poll - Breitbart,2016-02-05,"Sen. Marco Rubio ( ) has emerged as a legitimate challenger for first place in New Hampshire’s upcoming primary, with a new poll showing the Florida Senator is only ten points behind fellow Republican contender Donald Trump. [A Boston   poll published on Friday afternoon had Donald Trump in first place with 29 percent of the vote, followed by Rubio with 19 percent. The survey had Gov. John Kasich in third place with 13 percent, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush at 10 percent, and Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) at 7 percent to round out the top five.  The new poll represents the closest gap between first and second place since a   poll by ARG. After a strong showing in Iowa, much of the Republican establishment has united behind Sen. Rubio, helped along the way by increasingly favorable coverage from Fox News and the Wall Street Journal. Recognizing his rise in the polls, Rubio’s fellow establishment rivals have criticized the Florida Senator as someone who comes off as scripted and refuses to engage with the press. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie has called Rubio “the boy in the bubble,” noting how he is “scripted and controlled. ” “His   memorized speeches, all of which we’ve heard over and over and over again, are getting stale and tired,” Christie said. Christie’s accusations have been repeated by news networks. A CNN piece that ran Friday describes his “precision” antics: Marco Rubio is running a presidential campaign marked by precision, caution and discipline  —   so much so that the Florida senator delivers the exact same speech, jokes, quips and   wherever he goes   …     When he addresses the media, his aides select the reporters who can ask questions, often shutting down  . Another rival, Gov. Jeb Bush, has pointed to Rubio’s alleged lack of experience, saying the Senator has done very little in life other than work as a professional politician. A   super PAC, New Day for America, has criticized Rubio for voting against reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act."
330,Phil Jackson’s inscrutable tweet about leopards’ spots appears to be a shot at Carmelo Anthony,2017-02-08,"’  ’ ’   There is almost nothing to feel good about right now if you are   the New York Knicks. ’ ’   On Monday night, the team was blown out by the lowly Los   Angeles Lakers to fall to a stunningly bad   on the season.   On Tuesday, team president Phil Jackson took to Twitter to share   some rather inscrutable thoughts that, after   a   appear to be a shot at Carmelo Anthony for   not being the sort of winner both former Jackson superstars   Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant were. ’ ’   First, the tweet:  ’ ’ ’ ” ’t’t’tBleacher’s Ding almost rings the bell, but I learned you don’t change the spot on a leopard with Michael Graham in my CBA daze. ’t’t” ’   A T. S. Eliot poem this is not. ’ ’   Rather, Jackson seems to be referring to a recent column in    (”Bleacher’’s Ding”). In   Ding’’s column, he criticizes both Anthony and Jackson: Anthony   for not having what he calls the ”will to win” a la past   Jackson superstars, and Jackson for naively believing he could   mold Anthony into a player like Jordan or Bryant.  ’ ’  ’ ’   Returning to Jackson’’s tweet, he seems to be saying that Ding’’s   assessment of the situation is nearly correct (it   ”almost rings the bell”). ’ ’   The difference, however, is that in Jackson’’s mind he knew he   could never change Anthony. Jackson here refers to his   days (”daze”) coaching former Georgetown great Michael   Graham on the Albany Patroons in the Continental Basketball   Association (”CBA”).  Graham was a talented player but never had   the discipline to make it in the NBA. He was also kicked off   the Albany team for fighting with Jackson. ’ ”   In other words, you can never change a player  —   in Jackson’s   parlance, you can’t change a leopard’s spots.   ” ”   If this seems like a rather cryptic way for Jackson to basically   say that he knew he could never make Carmelo an NBA champion,   even when he decided to give him a   clause, well, that’s   Phil Jackson for you. Not to mention the fact that this is a   ridiculous and petty way to bash your   player.  ” ”   It’s notable that Jackson hasn’t tweeted since December 27, but   chooses to now, with the trade deadline fast approaching.   Anthony’s no trade clause allows him to veto any potentially   undesirable destinations, and that makes Jackson’s job a lot more   difficult. ” ’   And while there has been chattering about a potential trade to   the Cavaliers in exchange for Kevin Love, for now that seems   highly unlike. () ’ ’   One potential reading of this tweet is that Jackson is simply   trying to annoy Anthony with the hopes that Anthony will   waive his   clause in frustration. Who knows? ’ ’   As the ancient Zen koan goes, the Knicks are an   absolute mess. ’ ’There is almost nothing to feel good about. ..’"
331,Three More French Towns Set To Join Burkini Ban,2016-08-21,"(AFP)  —   Three resorts in France were poised Tuesday to join three other seaside towns in banning the burkini, the   Islamic swimming garment that has sparked concern about religious extremism. [Prime Minister Manuel Valls also weighed in on the debate, lashing the wearing of the burkini as “not compatible with the values of France and the Republic” and saying he supported mayors who ban it if they acted in the public good.  In the southwest, the mayor of the resort town of Leucate, Michel Py, was to sign a municipal decree later Tuesday that would ban the burkini on public beaches, the town hall said. The decree, which runs until August 31, will bar access to public beaches to “any person who is not properly dressed, respectful of moral behaviour and secularism, hygiene and bathing safety. ” “The wearing of bathing clothes which are associated with these principles is also forbidden,” according to the decree, seen by AFP. Leucate is located on the Mediterranean coast, 35 kilometres (20 miles) from Perpignan. In the northern French department of    the mayor of the Channel town of   said Tuesday he would also move to ban the burkini after seeing a woman wearing “a complete cape and gloves, covering her face and her eyes” as she headed to the beach on Sunday. In the nearby upmarket resort of Le Touquet, local mayor and MP Daniel Fasquelle said he would also implement a burkini ban in the coming days “to fight against religious proselytising. ” “There are no burkinis in Le Touquet at the moment, but I don’t want the town hall to be caught offguard if we are affected by this phenomenon,” Fasquelle told AFP. String of jihadist attacks, France has been hit by a string of jihadist attacks over the last 19 months that have left the country on edge and fretting over   religious extremism. Partly as a result, the burkini has become embroiled in a fierce debate about perceived religious symbols and their place in a strongly secular country. To critics, the garment is associated with an intolerant and sectarian strand of Islam. On July 14 Nice was the target of an attack claimed by the Islamic State group when a Tunisian ploughed a truck into crowds celebrating Bastille Day, killing 85. And on July 26, a priest was killed in his church in northwestern France by two attackers who had proclaimed their allegiance to IS. The following day, the Cote d’Azur city of Cannes banned the burkini and the nearby resort of   followed suit in early August. Beach brawl over burkinis, The Corsican town of Sisco on Sunday became the third to introduce a ban after a brawl in a cove between locals and families of North African origin left five people injured. A witness said the violence broke out after tourists took pictures of women swimming in burkinis on the Mediterranean island. Investigators are still probing what happened. The first ban on the burkini has been attributed to    close to Cannes, where it was discreetly barred in July 2013. The text of the municipal decree has been used, typically word for word, in bans elsewhere. Cannes mayor David Lisnard said he had signed off on the burkini ban out of “respect for good customs and secularism” a founding principle of the French republic. But   mayor Lionnel Luca had a different argument, saying swimming “fully dressed  …     (was) unacceptable for hygienic reasons. ” The bans are opposed by some, who contend they are a populist ploy, violate human rights and likely to inflame tensions. The Collective Against Islamophobia in France (CCIF) mounted an unsuccessful legal challenge to the ban in Cannes. It is now taking its case to the Council of State, the highest judicial authority in France for administrative matters. But Valls, in an interview published on Wednesday with the southern regional newspaper La Provence, said he supported the ban. “I understand mayors who, at this time of tension, respond by looking for solutions, by avoiding disturbances to public order,” Valls said. “I therefore support those who have passed (burkini) decrees if they are impelled by the will to encourage people to live together and not by ulterior political motives. ” Valls added: “Beaches, like all public areas, must be protected from religious claims. The burkini is not a new range of swimwear, a fashion. It is the expression of a political project, a   based notably on the enslavement of women. ” However, Valls ruled out a nationwide law to fight the burkini, saying “overall regulations on proscribing clothes cannot be a solution. ”"
332,Iraqi forces recapture key air base near Mosul ,2016-11-16," (CNN) Iraqi paramilitary forces have recaptured a strategic airbase outside the northern city of Tal Afar, a spokesman for the Popular Mobilization Forces said.  Ahmed al Assadi acknowledged that militia forces have yet to extinguish some pockets of ISIS resistance inside the airbase, however, saying late Wednesday that   operations will continue for the next few hours. Iraq’s Joint Operations Command put out a similar statement. The base will serve as a staging area for Iraqi Security Forces in their battle with ISIS west of Mosul, authorities said. Tal Afar is a predominantly Sunni city that used to be divided between Sunni and Shia Turkmens before ISIS captured it in 2014. It is about 70 kilometers (43 miles) west of Mosul. Mosul, Iraq’s   populous city, is ISIS’ last major stronghold in Iraq and the terror group is well entrenched there. The campaign to retake the city has raged on for a month, forcing nearly 59, 000 people to flee their homes, according to the United Nations. An ISIS attack on a Mosul neighborhood previously declared ”liberated” from the militants killed at least two civilians and wounded at least seven more people, including children, Iraqi army officials told CNN on Wednesday. The officials said at least four mortars landed in the eastern Mosul neighborhood of al Zahraa, which was declared under the full control of Iraqi security forces nearly a week ago.  Witnesses also told CNN there had been civilian deaths and injuries from the attacks. Video of the aftermath broadcast by local Kurdish TV station Rudaw showed several of the injured, including children with bloody wounds. Up to a dozen children are being maimed every day as fighting pushes into the city, according to Save the Children.  ”Many children have been through two years of ISIS and were then forced to flee through a war zone, and some told us they have seen people shot and hanged,” said Aram Shakaram, deputy country director for Save the Children in Iraq. ”Imagine what effect that would have on a child.”  The Iraq Joint Military Operations Command declared six days ago that its security forces had taken full control of al Zahraa as well as two other eastern neighborhoods    al Samah and al Malayeen. Attacks by ISIS in areas previously cleared by Iraqi forces are frequent. These areas often lack water, power and medical services, according to the UN.  Fierce resistance, Iraqi forces have encountered fierce resistance as they battle their way into Mosul.  While the ISIS presence has started to wane in parts of the northern city, a number of residents told CNN they are disappointed with the pace of Mosul’s liberation.   They said people are increasingly fearful because of what they see as slow advances by Iraqi forces.  ISIS has fortified its positions and regrouped after the Iraqi forces’ initial push on Mosul, which was faster than current progress, residents said.  The Mosul offensive began almost one month ago.  ISIS emboldened by leader’s message? Brig. Gen. Halgurd Hikmet, a spokesman for the Peshmerga, or Kurdish forces, told CNN on Wednesday that ”for ISIS, Mosul is survival.” Hikmet said he believes ISIS militants won’t leave Mosul but will continue to put up a fight that will only grow fiercer as the battle moves to the city’s west. He pointed to the audio message purportedly from ISIS leader Abu Bakr   released just weeks ago, which seems to have emboldened and inspired ISIS fighters. Hikmet also reiterated the difficulty posed for   forces by the potential for civilian casualties among the dense urban population, saying the utmost care was being taken not to bomb civilians.  The terror group’s use of civilians as ”human shields” is also a challenge because it’s often hard to differentiate between them and ISIS members, Hikmet said. The paramilitary force said Tuesday it has intelligence that   is somewhere between al Baaj and Tal Afar. The two cities are about 50 miles (80 kilometers) apart and close to the border with Syria. Iraqi Ministry of Defense spokesman Brig. Gen. Tahsin Ibrahim would not confirm nor deny that   is in the area.   coalition, Meanwhile, a military official said Tuesday that the   coalition against ISIS has pounded targets linked to the extremist group relentlessly since the   offensive began on October 17. In four weeks, coalition forces have hammered ISIS targets with 4, 000 bombs, artillery strikes and missiles, coalition spokesman Col. John C. Dorian said. They also have killed hundreds of fighters in the battle to retake Mosul, he said.  Nearly 60 vehicles equipped with bombs and more than 80 tunnels have been destroyed, Dorian said at a news conference in Qayyara. Aid groups stretched thin, The Mosul offensive has exacerbated widespread displacement of residents in northern Iraq and placed heavy demands on humanitarian groups working to provide aid for civilians fleeing the war, Refugees International said in a report Tuesday. Since ISIS began seizing territory across Iraq in 2014, 3. 3 million civilians have been displaced. The Mosul battle is spurring more civilian flight, the group says. The International Organization for Migration says more than 56, 000 people have been displaced since the start of the offensive. More resources are needed as tens of thousands of families have no place to stay, the leaders of NGOs and UN agencies said a joint statement.  ”With winter approaching, and temperatures dramatically dropping at night, families, many who fled their homes with virtually nothing, need heaters, blankets and other winter items.”  Save the Children reported that children who’ve been able to flee Mosul are showing signs of distress. The organization has set up tents to care for nearly 2, 000 children with classes."
333,Patients Lose Sight After Stem Cells Are Injected Into Their Eyes - The New York Times,2017-03-16,"Three women suffered severe, permanent eye damage after stem cells were injected into their eyes, in an unproven treatment at a loosely regulated clinic in Florida, doctors reported in an article published Wednesday in The New England Journal of Medicine. One, 72, went completely blind from the injections, and the others, 78 and 88, lost much of their eyesight. Before the procedure, all had some visual impairment but could see well enough to drive. The cases expose gaps in the ability of government health agencies to protect consumers from unproven treatments offered by entrepreneurs who promote the supposed healing power of stem cells. The women had macular degeneration, an eye disease that causes vision loss, and they paid $5, 000 each to receive   injections in 2015 at a private clinic in Sunrise, Fla. The clinic was part of a company then called Bioheart, now called U. S. Stem Cell. Staff members there used liposuction to suck fat out of the women’s bellies, and then extracted stem cells from the fat to inject into the women’s eyes. The disastrous results were described in detail in the journal article, by doctors who were not connected to U. S. Stem Cell and treated the patients within days of the injections. An accompanying article by scientists from the Food and Drug Administration warned that stem cells from fat “are being used in practice on the basis of minimal clinical evidence of safety or efficacy, sometimes with the claims that they constitute revolutionary treatments for various conditions. ” Kristin C. Comella, the chief science officer of U. S. Stem Cell, said in an interview that the clinic did not need F. D. A. approval because it was treating patients with their own cells, which are not a drug. She said the   treatments were comparable to patients’ receiving grafts of their own skin  —   a procedure not a drug. Two of the eye patients sued the clinic and settled, but it has faced no other penalties. Ms. Comella said it no longer treats eyes, but continues to treat five to 20 patients a week for other problems like torn knee cartilage and degenerating spinal discs. All three women found U. S. Stem Cell because it had listed a study on a government website, clinicaltrials. gov  —   provided by the National Institutes of Health. Two later told doctors they thought they were participating in   research. But no study ever took place, and the proposed study on the site had no government endorsement. Clinical trials do not need government approval to be listed on the website. Legitimate research rarely, if ever, charges patients to participate, scientists say, so the fees should have been a red flag. But many people do not know that. Promising   research in eye disease and other conditions is taking place. But researchers and health officials have been warning for years that patients are at risk from hundreds of private clinics that have sprung up around the United States and overseas, offering   treatments for all manner of ailments, like injured knees, damaged spinal discs, neurological diseases and heart failure. Businesses promising “regenerative medicine” have multiplied, with little or no regulation. Stem cells, which can develop into many different types of cells, are thought to have tremendous potential to repair or replace tissue damaged by disease, injury or aging. But so far, the F. D. A. has approved only a few   products to treat certain blood disorders. The women in Florida suffered detached retinas, in which the thin layer of   cells that send signals to the optic nerve pulls away from the back of the eye  —   a condition that usually needs prompt surgery to prevent blindness. Doctors who examined the patients said they suspected that the stem cells had grown onto the retina and then contracted, pulling it off the eyeball. One woman had such high pressure inside her eyes  —   about three times the normal level  —   that it may have damaged her optic nerves. Doctors operated quickly to relieve the pressure, but she became blind. “The really horrible thing about this is that you would never, nobody practicing good medicine would ever do an experimental procedure on a patient on both eyes on the same day,” said Dr. Thomas A. Albini, an author of the article who saw two of the patients, at the Bascom Palmer Eye Institute at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine. Standard practice, he said, is to treat one eye at a time, usually the worse eye first, so that if something goes wrong at least the patient still has one eye left with some vision. Dr. Albini said his team alerted the F. D. A. after the second patient showed up. “They did send an investigator who took statements from us,” he said. “They apparently wrote up a report, which as far as I know is still not finished or available for public consumption. ” Andrea Fischer, a spokeswoman for the F. D. A. said the agency could not comment on whether an investigation had been conducted. Two of the women were not available for interviews because their lawsuit settlements in 2016 included nondisclosure agreements, according to their lawyer, Andrew B. Yaffa, of Coral Gables, Fla. He also was barred from discussing the case, but a publicly available complaint he filed in July 2016 details one patient’s story, and states that the injections were performed by a nurse practitioner who was introduced as a physician. The third patient did not sue, but did not respond to a request for an interview made through her doctor. (The patients were not named in the journal article.) Ms. Comella, from U. S. Stem Cell, said that an independent review board had approved the proposed eye study, including the plan to treat both eyes at once. She said a total of three patients ever received eye injections at the clinic, and were not part of a trial. She declined to confirm that they were the same three patients described in the journal article, but the article links the women to the clinic. Ms. Comella said a trial never did begin, because the first three cases “ended the way they ended, so we decided not to go forward with any additional patients. ” She declined to discuss the cases further, citing the nondisclosure agreement. But she said that U. S. Stem Cell had successfully treated thousands of patients for other conditions, and that it was misleading to draw attention to “a handful of adverse events. ” U. S. Stem Cell also makes money by training doctors to extract stem cells from fat. And in a blog post on Tuesday its chief executive, Mike Tomás, said the company expected to open clinics throughout the Middle East, in Kuwait, Dubai and Qatar. But the company, which is a penny stock, is struggling financially, and as recently as last fall warned investors that its poor financial situation put it at risk of going out of business. Clinics like U. S. Stem Cell that extract stem cells from fat fall into a gray zone. Regulations say stem cells do not have to be F. D. A. approved if they are the patient’s own and are “minimally manipulated”  —   but some clinics may stretch that term to suit their own purposes. The F. D. A. website has a page that warns “the hope that patients have for cures not yet available may leave them vulnerable to unscrupulous providers of   treatments that are illegal and potentially harmful. ” The F. D. A. article in The New England Journal of Medicine suggested that adverse events from   treatments “are probably much more common than is appreciated, because there is no reporting requirement when these therapies are administered outside clinical investigations. ” Like the Florida patients, people who consult clinicaltrials. gov may assume that the studies listed there have been approved by the F. D. A. or the National Institutes of Health, but that is not necessarily the case, Renate Myles, an N. I. H. spokeswoman, said. In an email, Ms. Myles said, “The information on ClinicalTrials. gov is provided by the study sponsor or principal investigator and posting on ClinicalTrials. gov does not necessarily reflect endorsement by the N. I. H. ClinicalTrials. gov does not independently verify the scientific validity or relevance of the trial itself beyond a limited quality control review. ” Ms. Myles said that the site urges patients to consult their own doctors about joining studies and includes caveats in multiple places. “However, we agree that such caveats need to be clearer to all users and will be adding a more prominent disclaimer in the near future,” she added."
334,How you can create space in a tiny home - The New York Times,2017-05-12,"This article is part of a series aimed at helping you navigate life’s opportunities and challenges. What else should we write about? Contact us: smarterliving@nytimes. com. Let go of that   you’ve had since middle school, the cracked mirror that you haven’t had time to replace and the lamp that works only when you kick it on the third try. When you’re trying to maximize a small space, every inch counts, from under the bed to unclaimed wall space over your head. While moving is considered one of life’s great stressors, living in a small space doesn’t have to be. All it takes is some thoughtful planning and smart storage options. For Julia Haney Montanez, an interior designer living alone for the first time in Manhattan’s Chelsea neighborhood, purging is the first step to making the most of what you have. “You have to stop being a hoarder,” Ms. Montanez, 30, said this week in her studio apartment. “The secret to   living is trying to avoid owning too much stuff that’s a good practice for life. You don’t have to be a minimalist, but you have to get really creative where you store your things and maybe think twice about buying something new. ” (Related: A beginner’s guide to home décor) Once you’ve winnowed down your belongings, it’s time to consider how to use your limited space. Ms. Montanez, a producer for the Architectural Digest show and a freelance designer, lives in a    studio. When she first moved in, Ms. Montanez spent hours looking at the floor plan and figuring out the ideal configuration for her furniture. By living in the space for a while before making any major purchases, Ms. Montanez said, you get an idea of how to make your home as functional as possible. “As you live in the apartment you’ll know and understand what you need,” she said. “Do you have your freeloader friends crashing all the time? Then get a longer sofa. If not, get a smaller sofa because they take up so much space. Get to know your own space before you start throwing money at those things. ” If you have the opportunity to splurge, Ms. Montanez recommends creating a custom piece. For her it was a California Closet and a table that doubles as her office desk. “It was the best decision,” she said of the custom closet. “Everything goes in there. ” Shoes, cleaning supplies and home office material like fabric swatches all live in her closet, neatly tucked away in designated cubbies alongside double hanging clothes racks. “Take your dinner money for the next month and put it toward something that will fit perfectly,” she said. “It’s like Tetris, and it’s that one thing you need. ” Making a tight spot work can require bending the rules on traditional uses of space. Consider using a medicine cabinet for storing glassware or kitchen cabinets for sweater storage if cooking isn’t a priority. Every space has to serve a purpose, said Susan Winberg, an interior designer based in New York City. “It has to have more than one function,” she said. Ms. Winberg typically takes on larger residential projects, she said, but with two children in their 20s, she began designing projects with much more limited space. Her daughter’s San Francisco   apartment, for example, had a Murphy bed alcove with no bed in it, she said. They put her bed elsewhere in the apartment and converted the alcove into a closet. If you have limited closet space, prioritize where you store your things, Ms. Winberg advised. The Murphy bed closet is tucked away, so Ms. Winberg’s daughter uses that area to store winter clothes and boots, saving her more accessible closet for things that she uses more regularly. If you’re working with a dresser, add another piece or shelf above the dresser for extra storage, she said. Madeline Fraser, one of the founders of a new app called Homee, which offers personal design services and a virtual showroom, summed up a similar approach to coping with small spaces in two words: up and out. “The use of the wall space is where you’re going to maximize your overall space,” she said. Ms. Fraser recommended putting storage on walls with open floating shelving, an affordable option, she said, especially for renters who can easily Spackle the wall when it’s time to move out. And shelving can go beyond the living room and bedroom, too. Open shelving in kitchens, especially in a galley or small kitchen, can make the room feel more open. “When you have cabinets, it can appear closed off like there’s a wall there,” she said. Everyone thinks, ‘Oh, I have to have cabinets,’ but you can easily do open shelving and arrange your kitchen stuff to look cool. It will feel more like a restaurant. ” To keep things looking tidy, Ms. Fraser suggested bringing symmetry to open shelves by displaying dishes, cutting boards and kitchen accessories stacked in clusters or leaning against the wall. Books and bookends offer a way to ground shelving, too, she said. And for miscellaneous items, wire baskets can help contain odds and ends that may be without a home. At a bare minimum, get the mattress and box spring off the floor, Ms. Fraser said. Every big piece of furniture should have legs if possible, to provide storage space underneath. “You can get an   bed frame that gives you more storage under your bed,” she said. “You can do a bed skirt and put a lot under your bed. Your mom will not be happy with you if she comes over and sees the bed on the floor. ” Want more?

336,"Sexual Assault Suspect Not Allowed to Defend Himself, Could Cause ’Psychological Harm’ to Accuser - Breitbart",2017-02-01,"A student at Amherst College in Massachusetts accused of sexual misconduct is being refused the right to defend himself on the basis that it could cause “psychological harm” to his accuser. [The unnamed student was expelled from Amherst College despite arguing that his accuser had actually assaulted him, while a judge blocked his attempt to subpoena his accuser into releasing text messages on the grounds that   the case “would impose emotional and psychological trauma” on her.  “[The student] was blackout drunk at the time —  a detail that Amherst administrators deemed ‘credible,’ on subsequent review,” wrote Reason, who used the “John Doe” placeholder name for the student, before adding, “Of course, it’s questionable whether a blackout drunk student can actually provide the level of consent that Amherst’s sexual misconduct policy requires. ” The incident in question took place years ago, during the late night   early morning hours of February   2012. Jones was Doe’s girlfriend’s roommate at the time. Jones went to Doe’s dorm room and sexual activity ensued: Jones performed oral sex on Doe. But Doe was blackout drunk at the time —  a detail that Amherst administrators deemed “credible,” on subsequent review. Of course, it’s questionable whether a blackout drunk student can actually provide the level of consent that Amherst’s sexual misconduct policy requires. Other factors cast doubt on the idea that Jones was the victim and Doe the perpetrator. After leaving Doe’s dorm room, Jones texted another male student and asked him to come to her dorm room for sex. She also texted a residential advisor about her “stupid” decision to engage in sexual activity with her roommate’s boyfriend. In these text messages, Jones admitted that she was “not an innocent bystander. ” She also complained about how long it was taking this second male student to do anything sexual with her. She did not file a complaint against Doe until two years later. Based upon the “preponderance of the evidence” standard that was established by the Obama administration, Doe was expelled from Amherst. Legal scholars KC Johnson and Stuart Taylor of The Volokh Conspiracy at The Washington Post argue that the preponderance standard established by the “Dear Colleague” letter of the Obama administration “told all of the more than 7, 000 colleges that receive federal money to use the lowest possible standard of proof” in determining the outcome of sexual assault cases on college campuses. President Trump’s Secretary of Education nominee Betsy DeVos was harshly criticized by the left for donating to the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE) which supports the notion that the burden of proof in campus sexual assault cases should be higher and that all accused should be afforded proper due process.

337,Elector says he will not cast vote for Trump,2016-12-06,"Washington (CNN) A Texas elector said Monday that enough is enough    he will not cast his vote for   Donald Trump as part of the Electoral College process on December 19. Christopher Suprun, a paramedic from Texas who served as a firefighter during the Sept. 11 attacks, wrote in an editorial published in The New York Times that even though he is a Republican elector, he will not vote for Trump. Suprun will cast his vote along with the other electors (538 in total) from every state and the District of Columbia on December 19 as part of the Electoral College process.  ”Fifteen years ago, I swore an oath to defend my country and Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic,” he wrote. ”On Dec. 19, I will do it again.” Suprun ends the editorial by saying that the electors still have a chance to unify behind a Republican alternative such as Ohio Gov. John Kasich. Along with Suprun, 36 other electors planning to vote for Trump would have to abandon their vote for him    which is almost beyond the realm of possibility. Even if Suprun doesn’t cast his vote for Trump, Trump is headed toward the 270 votes he needs to become president in January.  In the editorial Suprun explained that he believes Trump has shown he’s not qualified for the Oval Office. He wrote that the last time the nation was united was after the Sept. 11 attacks, while Trump has failed ”to unite America” and drove ”a wedge between us.” ”He does not encourage civil discourse, but chooses to stoke fear and create outrage,” Suprun wrote in the editorial. Joe Biden leaves the door open for a 2020 run, Suprun added that Trump’s actions, such as saying ”Russia should hack Hillary Clinton’s emails” and urging ”violence against protesters at his rallies during the campaign” show that he is not qualified to be president. He also wrote about how the advisers Trump surrounds himself with, including retired Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn for National Security Adviser and Steve Bannon, a former Breitbart executive named to a senior adviser position, are not positive influences on him. ”He has surrounded himself with advisers such as Stephen K. Bannon, who claims to be a Leninist and lauds villains and their thirst for power, including Darth Vader,” he wrote. ”Gen. Michael T. Flynn, Mr. Trump’s pick for national security adviser, has his own checkered past about rules.”"
338,Trump gushes over ’very nice’ Christmas letter from Putin amid mounting tension between the countries,2016-12-24,"’  ’ ’     Donald Trump on Friday fawned over a Christmas   letter he received from Russian President Vladimir Putin. ’ ’   The   announced in a statement he received a ”very   nice letter” from the Russian president, and that Putin’’s   ”thoughts are so correct.” ’ ’   ”I hope both sides are able to live up to these thoughts,” Trump   wrote, ”and we do not have to travel an alternate path. ’ ’   Trump did not make clear what an alternate path would be, but the   letter came amid increased tension between the two countries and   as the two leaders have both called for their nations to increase   the capabilities of their nuclear weapons programs. ’ ’   In the letter, dated December 15 but released by Trump on Friday,   Putin extended his ”warmest Christmas and New Year greetings” to   ”his excellency Donald Trump” and offered ”sincere wishes to you   and your family of sound health, happiness, well being, success,   and all the best.” ’ ’   ”Serious global and regional challenges, which our countries have   to face in recent years, show that the relations between Russia   and the US remain an important factor in ensuring stability and   security of the modern world,” Putin wrote. ’ ’   The Russian president continued: ”I hope that after you assume   the position of the president of the United States of America we   will be able  —   by acting in a constructive and pragmatic manner  —     to take real steps to restore the framework of bilateral   cooperation in different areas as well as bring out level of   collaboration on the international scene to a qualitatively new   level.” ’ ”   Trump’s release of the letter came as   relations have   tensed in recent days. ” ’   President Barack Obama spent much of his   press   conference last week  warning the   country that the US ”can do stuff” to it. US intelligence   agencies have assessed that Russia was attempting to intervene in   the US election through hacks with the goal of assisting Trump to   victory. ’ ’   On Wednesday,  almost all communication   channels between Moscow and the US were frozen. ’ ’   And on Thursday, Putin boasted about the strength of his   military, claiming it was more powerful than any potential   aggressor.

340,Tom Coughlin Resigns After 12 Seasons as NY Giants Head Coach - Breitbart,2016-01-04,"Tom Coughlin resigned as head coach of the New York Giants Monday after 12 seasons at the helm. [Coughlin released a statement through the Giants:  I met with John Mara and Steve Tisch this afternoon, and I informed them that it is in the best interest of the organization that I step down as head coach. I strongly believe the time is right for me and my family, and as I said, the Giants organization. It has been an honor and a privilege to serve as head coach of the New York Football Giants. This is a not a sad occasion for me. I have spent 15 years with this organization as an assistant and head coach and was fortunate to be part of three Super Bowl winning teams. A Lombardi Trophy every five years is an achievement in which we all take great pride. Obviously, the past three years have not been what any of us expect, and as head coach, I accept the responsibility for those seasons. I think it has been evident these last 12 years here how much pride I take in representing this franchise. I am gratified and proud that we were able to deliver two more Lombardi trophies to the display case in our lobby during that time. That is a tribute to our players and staff, and it was truly fulfilling to be the leader of those teams. I appreciate the support of John and his family and Steve and his family, and of Jerry Reese and his staff. I think our organization is a great representation of what I mean when I talk about ‘team.’ Finally, I would be remiss if I did not thank my wife Judy and our four children and their spouses and our 11 (soon to be 12) grandchildren. None of this would have been possible without their unconditional love and support. Although the Giants fielded a potent offense in 2015, the team struggled to a   record, good for third in a weak NFC East. This season marked the fourth in a row that the Giants failed to make the playoffs. Coughlin led the Giants to two Super Bowl victories and retires as one of the more successful coaches in this history of an organization whose coaching tree includes Bill Belichick, Tom Landry, and Vince Lombardi, and whose head coaches include Bill Parcells, Steve Owen, and Jim Lee Howell. New York likely represents the last stop in the   ’s head coaching career. After coaching Boston College to a winning record, he led the Jacksonville Jaguars to the best years in franchise history, which included four of the team’s five playoff wins, and a   record coaching the Giants."
341,"Zika Infection in U.S. Is Still Rare So Far, Blood Donations Indicate - The New York Times",2016-11-15,"By the end of this week, all blood banks in the continental United States must begin testing donated blood for contamination with the Zika virus. Many banks are doing so already, and the early results indicate that the country has dodged a bullet  —   for now. Screenings in a dozen states suggest that Zika infection remains exceedingly rare. Among the approximately 800, 000 blood donations tested in the past six months or so, about 40 were initially positive for the virus. “It is good news that we are avoiding the transmission of Zika,” said Dr. Susan Rossmann, the chief medical officer at Gulf Coast Regional Blood Center in Houston. Still, she noted, it may not be surprising there are so few possibly positive cases, because blood banks have been dissuading people from donating if they recently traveled to an area in which the virus is circulating. Blood donation screening for Zika is performed with tests made by Roche Molecular Systems or by a collaboration between two medical companies, Hologic Inc. and Grifols. The screening effort is regulated as two gigantic clinical trials in which every blood donor is enrolled as a participant. All the results, therefore, are reported to the companies. By Friday, Roche’s machines had screened 475, 000 donations in the United States, excluding Puerto Rico. Just 25 have been “initially reactive” for Zika infection, said Tony Hardiman, who leads the company’s blood screening program. “Compared to Puerto Rico, it’s tiny,” he said. Roughly 1 percent of the blood donors in Puerto Rico were infected by July, with 1. 8 percent of them testing initially positive in the last week of surveillance, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. By   roughly 348, 000 donations had been screened using the test made by Hologic Inc. and Grifols. Fourteen were initially positive for the Zika virus. It may be that not all of these samples are truly contaminated. The technology is still in development, and the manufacturers are scrambling to confirm their results with further investigations of the donors. Of three donors examined by Hologic and Grifols, all seem to have been infected outside the United States. One donor gave blood at United Blood Services in Reno, Nev. after visiting Nicaragua. Another, a New Yorker, had been to Trinidad. The third lives in Arizona and had visited Mexico. All three donors had minute traces of the Zika virus in their blood, detected between 41 and 97 days after travel abroad, Jeffrey Linnen, an associate vice president at Hologic, told attendees at a recent conference for AABB, the   group for most blood banks nationwide. Viral material detected after 40 days is unlikely to be live virus, said Dr. David O. Freedman, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. “The farther along you are after infection, the more likely you are just detecting residual breakdown products from dead virus pieces that are still circulating,” he said. In August, the Food and Drug Administration required all blood banks to screen each of the millions of blood donations collected annually for Zika. Eleven states in   areas had to put in the new safeguards in a month. The rest must do so by Friday. At the time, experts feared that   mosquitoes would begin turning up in states along the Gulf Coast, prompting outbreaks like those seen in South America and threatening the nation’s supply of donated blood. Universal screening was necessary to avoid transmission of the Zika virus in donated blood, particularly to pregnant women. If exposed to the virus in utero, fetuses can have brain damage, visual and joint problems, and muscle tone so rigid it restricts movement. Florida is the only state with documented local transmission of the virus. In July, the F. D. A. temporarily halted collection of blood donations in   and Broward Counties until screening for the Zika virus could be put in place. Blood banks perform the screenings themselves or, more often, pay a laboratory to insure donations are  . The additional costs are passed on to hospitals. The range is from $6 to $10 a unit, Dr. Rossmann said. “It’s not inconsiderable, that’s for sure. ” One 2011 survey found that hospitals paid $210 on average for a unit of red blood cells, after screening for pathogens. The cost of blood is increasing, the researchers also concluded. “The F. D. A. requirement made it pretty clear that we don’t have much of a choice, and the hospitals don’t have much of a choice,” Dr. Rossmann said. Meeting the deadlines has been a monumental task for blood banks. Introducing a new test to screen donations usually takes six to 12 months. The F. D. A. ’s timeline was just one month for blood banks in Florida and 11 other states thought to be at high risk for Zika outbreaks, and three months for those in 38 other states. “It was extremely painful, extremely expensive,” said Phillip Williamson, the vice president for operations and scientific affairs at Creative Testing Solutions. “This was an unfunded mandate from our government. ” Rhode Island Blood Center, for example, acquired two new machines to screen 153, 000 annual donations and trained 17 employees to load blood samples and run the automated testing around the clock. “We’ve been scrambling to get ready,” said Dr. Carolyn Young, the chief medical officer. In the coming months, the main threat to the blood supply will be the roughly 4, 000 travelers infected with the Zika virus while abroad. Most do not have symptoms. Dr. Lyle Petersen, the director of the division of   diseases at the C. D. C. has called the number of travel cases in the continental states “extraordinary. ” The fear is not that they will all seek to donate blood, but that they will serve as vectors by which the Zika virus will spread in the population, even when the mosquitoes that carry the infection are not present. Sexual transmission is the likeliest route. “When people come back from trips, they generally have sex pretty soon,” Dr. Petersen recently told a packed room at an annual conference for blood transfusion experts. In all cases the C. D. C. has studied, he said, “transmission from infected travelers to their nontraveler partners has occurred within 20 days of the first sexual contact. ” Recently infected travelers have higher levels of Zika in their blood, semen and other bodily fluids, and are probably more infectious. Blood banks had been asking donors about their travel history and that of their sexual partners, and then asking them to postpone donating for at least a month. To prove that their new tests work reliably enough to be licensed, Hologic, Grifols and Roche may need to enroll millions of participants in their continuing trials. Roughly seven million people give blood annually Creative Testing Solutions screens about a third of them. “We have to sign up every one of those people for a clinical trial,” Dr. Williamson said. While the nonprofit can handle the burden, he added, “I’m sure a lot of places out there are struggling as the result of the aggressive implementation guidelines mandated by F. D. A. ” Still, most experts agree that universal screening is costly but necessary if the country wishes to avoid even a single instance in which a child is   because of a transfusion of contaminated blood. The Community Blood Bank of Northwest Pennsylvania and Western New York, based in Erie, Pa. has been drawing extra tubes of blood from donors to fly overnight to a Houston laboratory for Zika screening at $6 to $10 a sample. “Compared to the overall cost of health care,” said Scott Greenwell, the executive director of the blood bank, “this is spit in the ocean. ”"
342,Trump Has Options for Undoing Obama’s Climate Legacy - The New York Times,2016-12-03,"  Donald J. Trump has vowed to dismantle many of the signature policies put in place by the Obama administration to fight the effects of climate change. During the campaign, he threatened, among other things, to kill the Clean Power Plan, a set of rules to reduce emissions from power plants. He has also taken aim at new regulations to limit methane leaks from wells and pipelines. And members of his transition team have suggested that he may reduce or eliminate basic climate research at NASA or other agencies. If he follows through, most of these moves will be opposed by environmental groups, by Democrats in Congress and perhaps even by some Republicans. But Mr. Trump will have several tools to begin nullifying the Obama climate agenda. One of them is the   Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, a small outpost within the executive branch that has, since the Clinton administration, been the last stop for many regulations before they go into effect. Lawyers in the office pore over thousands of pages of federal regulations daily and pride themselves on meticulously reviewing the fine print, even if that takes months or years. Under the control of the new administration, the office could slow President Obama’s latest regulatory initiatives by repeatedly sending them back for additional work. “It has been a brake on agency regulation throughout its lifetime,” said Jody Freeman, a professor at Harvard Law School and an expert on environmental regulation. “Some presidents have used it as more of a brake than others. ” Much remains to be learned about the  ’s environmental policy goals, and some of his views appear to have shifted. Mr. Trump, who has claimed that global warming is a hoax, said this week in an interview with The New York Times that he now saw “some connectivity” between humans and climate change, and that he would “keep an open mind” about whether to pull out of the Paris climate accord, as he threatened to do during the campaign. Yet at the same time, some key positions on his transition team are occupied by people with a long history of rejecting the overwhelming scientific consensus on climate change. Other than climate change, there are numerous environmental issues that he has never talked about and that he might be content to leave untouched. And once agency heads are in place, they may choose very different tactics from those discussed during Mr. Trump’s campaign or by his advisers. Two people considered to be in the running to head the Environmental Protection Agency  —   Jeffrey R. Holmstead, an energy lobbyist, and Robert E. Grady, a venture capitalist  —   also have experience in the complex machinations of the federal government. “Every new administration comes in with an overestimation of what it can accomplish and how quickly it can accomplish it,” said Kevin Ewing, a partner at Bracewell, a Washington law firm. If Mr. Trump does decide to withdraw from the Paris agreement, he will find it difficult: The accord went into force this month. He would also encounter tremendous obstacles were he to try to dismantle the E. P. A. another campaign threat. But he may have an easier time abandoning other climate initiatives, including a United   program to reduce the environmental impact of international air travel beginning in 2020. The United States has only informally committed to participate in the program, and the new administration could refuse to make that commitment legally binding. One of the most powerful methods to hobble Mr. Obama’s domestic environmental initiatives would be to block financing for the E. P. A. and other agencies. “Congress can always pass an appropriations rider that for one year prevents any funding for the implementation or enforcement of a particular regulation,” said Scott H. Segal, a partner and director of the policy resolution group at Bracewell. Riders can be passed year after year, effectively neutering a specific regulation, Mr. Segal said. Such an approach can be “stealthier” than trying to undo the regulation itself, Professor Freeman said. “You don’t have to repeal these statutes,” she said. “You just have to make it impossible to implement them. ” Another opening for Mr. Trump lies in regulations that were proposed by the Obama administration but are still technically “in motion. ” In theory, he could pull back or block these rules. But a departing administration can also use a regulation’s “in motion” status to its own advantage. Last week, the Obama administration banned drilling in the Alaskan Arctic under the Interior Department’s proposed   plan regulating oil and gas leases. Republicans could kill the plan. But to do so would mean crafting a replacement, a process that could take two years or more. Last week, the White House unveiled a sweeping plan to try to stiffen environmental regulations before Mr. Obama leaves office. Environmental groups can be expected to fight any efforts to undo them. “Donald Trump can’t just snap his fingers and change climate policy,” said David Goldston, director of government affairs at the Natural Resources Defense Council. “We have ways to thwart him in Congress and the courts that we could employ. ” The approach the Trump administration takes will depend in part on the status of specific rules and regulations. Some environmental policies  —   like “guidance” issued by the White House earlier this year, instructing agencies to consider the effects of climate change when conducting environmental reviews  —   do not have the force of law that agency regulations do, and can be abolished with a pen stroke. Undoing a regulation is more complicated. Some of the E. P. A. ’s new methane rules are completed, for example, but other rules, both at the E. P. A. and at the Interior Department, are not and can simply be abandoned. If a rule is final, the options are different. The new administration cannot just rescind these regulations, but it can order agencies to revisit them. That reopens the   process, however, including the opportunity for public comment. Any revisions or replacement regulations must have a basis in facts and a   analysis, not politics or ideology. There are other potential options for specific regulations. The Clean Power Plan, for instance, is completed but not yet in effect because of a judicial stay imposed while legal action against it plays out in a federal appeals court in Washington. If there is no ruling by Inauguration Day, Jan. 20, Mr. Trump’s Justice Department can ask the court to put the case in abeyance, effectively extending the stay indefinitely. “In some respects, this is in the Department of Justice’s hands,” said Tom Lorenzen, a lawyer at Crowell  Moring who argued against the plan before the appeals court. “They will make a determination of how they want to proceed. ” Mr. Segal said the Republican Congress might also be able to overturn some recently completed regulations under a law that gives both houses up to 60 legislative days to reject them. That law, the Congressional Review Act, usually comes into play only when the party of the incoming president is different from the departing one’s and the same party controls both houses, as is the case now. William K. Reilly, a Republican who was E. P. A. administrator under President George Bush, said Mr. Trump needed to be careful about whom he picked for the top jobs in each department. He cited the Reagan administration’s experience with Anne Gorsuch, who incurred the wrath of politicians of both parties when, as administrator of the E. P. A. she cut the agency’s budget by more than 20 percent, gutting research and regulatory enforcement. She resigned under fire in 1983 in the midst of accusations that she had mismanaged a hazardous waste cleanup program. “The administration got badly burned by discounting the sensitivities and public support for what the E. P. A. protects us from,” Mr. Reilly said. “It’s a public health agency above all. ”"
343,The Diva Departs: Renée Fleming’s Farewell to Opera - The New York Times,2017-04-08,"Richard Strauss’s opera “Der Rosenkavalier” is about the passage of time. It’s the story of a wealthy married woman, the Marschallin, who is having an affair with a much younger man, and who realizes that she is getting older and that he will sooner or later move on. Her most famous aria, at the end of the first act, is about wanting to stop the clocks. At the end of the opera, to music so full of feeling Strauss wanted it played at his own funeral, she accepts the inevitable and graciously surrenders her lover to a younger woman. Robert Carsen’s new staging of “Rosenkavalier,” which had its debut in London this winter and opens at the Metropolitan Opera on Thursday, April 13, emphasizes the theme of change and upheaval by moving the setting from   Vienna to the moment when the piece was written, at the twilight of the Hapsburg Empire and the eve of World War I. It becomes an opera about the end of an era, or even the end of the world. For Renée Fleming, the superstar soprano who will sing the Marschallin at the Met, and for music, this really is the end of an era: This “Rosenkavalier” may well be her farewell to staged opera. She will sing her final performance on the afternoon of Saturday, May 13. People who know Ms. Fleming, 58, say that she has been planning this moment for years. The novelist Ann Patchett, who became friends with her after finishing “Bel Canto,” about a diva with many   traits, said recently: “For as long as I’ve known Renée, the thing she always talks about is the fact that it’s all going to end. She has always had this feeling: ‘I’m a carton of yogurt with an expiration date stamped on it, and that day will come and I’ll be thrown out. ’” So Ms. Fleming is trying to say goodbye on her own terms. “You don’t want people to be saying, ‘Oh my God, please stop,’” she said in London as she prepared to finish the “Rosenkavalier” run there. “Or, ‘I heard her when. ’” Her departure is a watershed moment for her extravagant, expensive art form, which is always imagining itself in trouble  —   what is opera about except crises?  —   but may really be in peril this time. Not only is opera more divorced than ever from mainstream culture, but also its core audience, the people who buy subscriptions, is literally dying off. The Met has had some luck attracting new operagoers through social media, collaborations with theater and visual artists, and fresher branding, but the most reliable way of ensuring attendance is still by casting big international stars, and one of Ms. Fleming’s magnitude is almost impossible to replace. Plácido Domingo, the only singer on her level still performing, is 76, and, though he keeps defying time, can’t go on forever younger artists like Anna Netrebko and Jonas Kaufmann may be   but are hardly household names. “A superstar is that intangible thing,” said Mary Lou Falcone, the publicist who in 1998 helped guide Ms. Fleming through a crisis of confidence so severe she almost quit opera after being booed in Milan. “Nothing can explain it. After all the projections and trajectories, the public either latches on or it doesn’t. ” Drawn to Ms. Fleming’s combination of glamour and accessibility  —   she became known as “the people’s diva”  —   the public did latch on. Invited to sing David Letterman’s Top 10 list, and to record, in the original Elvish, some of the soundtrack for the third “Lord of the Rings” movie, she gained a following among people who, strictly speaking, weren’t opera buffs at all. In many cases, Ms. Fleming was the first and only opera singer they’d ever paid attention to. She has sold over two million records, a huge number for opera, and won four Grammy Awards. In 2014, she became the first opera singer to deliver the national anthem at the Super Bowl. In 2015, she made the jump from Lincoln Center to Broadway to appear (as a tetchy diva) in the play “Living on Love. ” “Her huge ambition was not just to be an opera star,” said Matthew Epstein, Ms. Fleming’s manager from 1995 to 1999. “She wanted to be Beyoncé. She still does. ” Like Beyoncé, and unlike many of her opera colleagues, Ms. Fleming has gone about her stage career  —   and, now, her plans for after  —   with unusual deliberation. “Renée is not like other singers,” said Peter Gelb, the general manager of the Met. “I’m not saying she’s the only one who’s nice. But she’s very calm. Whatever fears or horrors she has are well hidden. ” Mr. Epstein recalled a period in the 1990s when Ms. Fleming was making a specialty of “Der Rosenkavalier. ” “She said to me: ‘I think I’m going to stop now, and this is something I can come back to at the end,’” he said. “The arc of a career is complicated. It’s hard to start a career, and it’s even harder to end one elegantly. So I think this is a very smart and considered decision on her part. It’s called going out at the top. ” Mr. Carsen, who has also directed Ms. Fleming in some of her most acclaimed productions, including Handel’s “Alcina” and Tchaikovsky’s “Eugene Onegin,” said: “Renée has been one of the most glamorous and really beautiful singers. A beautiful woman in every respect. It was never in the cards that as the years moved on she was going to start playing people’s mothers. ” Ms. Fleming turned 58 in February. Her friend and mentor Leontyne Price was the same age when she retired from the opera stage in 1985, and there is a famous YouTube video of her struggling to keep it together as she receives an endless ovation. It’s hard to believe that Ms. Fleming won’t puddle up a little at her last performance. But in London in January, on the morning after her    “Rosenkavalier” at the Royal Opera House, she was anything but nostalgic. Sitting in the kitchen of her flat on one of the city’s most posh streets, she seemed less a forlorn diva than the very organized and energetic, very American chief executive of a small company: Let’s call it Renee Fleming Inc. “My guide to this whole process, when I was thinking about what to do, was Leontyne Price,” she said in her surprisingly deep speaking voice  —   so low she once saw a speech therapist, fearing it might be bad for her singing. “She said that her concertizing afterward was when she had the most fun, and she also said something to the effect that she felt she was no longer surrounded by her colleagues. That becomes true very quickly  —   pretty soon your colleagues are of another generation. ” Ms. Fleming insisted that she wouldn’t stop singing entirely but that she was just changing her focus. She plans to give more concerts (which, though she didn’t say so, are both easier and far more lucrative than singing staged opera) make more records, find new music to sing, and spend more time at the Lyric Opera of Chicago, where she was named creative consultant in 2010. (Some have speculated that position might be a steppingstone to running an opera company herself.) She said she was even thinking of getting involved in an internet   for streaming arts programs. Some of Ms. Fleming’s fame is a result of arriving at the right moment, when there were still powerful management and record companies to promote her career. Some is a result of calculation and astute  . Following the advice of Ms. Falcone, whom she hired in 1995, she lost weight and started paying more attention to her hair and wardrobe. (Nowadays, according to Ms. Patchett, she dresses up even to go to Kinko’s at 8 in the morning.) But it couldn’t have happened without her voice  —   shimmering and lustrous. Her detractors sometimes claim that Ms. Fleming’s voice is actually too much of a good thing: too lush, too creamy. She has been called the June Cleaver of opera singers  —   too bland, in other words  —   and her voice has been described as Botoxed, so plump and seamless that it lacks dramatic expressiveness. Ms. Fleming’s sound hasn’t darkened with age, as often happens to sopranos. (If it had, she might have ended up with a wider choice of roles in her 50s). She’s not as virtuosic as she once was, but whether you like her voice or not, she still sounds much the way she did 25 years ago. It hasn’t hurt her career that, as Mr. Carsen pointed out, Ms. Fleming is also very beautiful, with a   face, high cheekbones and unusually large eyes, which onstage are as expressive as a silent film star’s: a  ’s ideal of what an opera singer should look like. And unlike some earlier divas, for whom the job description seemed to include being as difficult offstage as was humanly possible, she is, for a superstar, almost unnaturally normal and unaffected. She loves to interact with her most devoted fans and even makes a point of remembering their names. Sue Schardt, a friend of hers since college, said Ms. Fleming hasn’t changed much since they shared a dorm room. “Renée’s not just humble,” she said. “She’s chronically humble. ” Ms. Fleming grew up outside of Rochester, where her parents were both music teachers. She was gifted, but not a prodigy, and there wasn’t enough money to send her to a fancy conservatory like Oberlin College, her first choice. So she enrolled in the Crane School of Music at the State University of New York at Potsdam, where she majored not in performance but in music education, assuming she’d follow in her parents’ footsteps. She has said that back then she had no idea how to sing and sounded like a “buzzing insect,” which isn’t quite true. Ms. Schardt shared an ancient tape recording of Ms. Fleming singing in the student union, and she sounds not unlike a young Joni Mitchell, her idol at the time. “Renée was always doing surprising things,” Ms. Schardt recalled. “So does it surprise me, the career she has now and what she’s developed into? No. Is it something we were thinking about when we graduated in 1981? No. It all goes back to being a   girl from central New York. At the core, that’s who she is. She’s a working singer, and these are gigs. What grounds her is her friends, her family, her girls. ” (Ms. Fleming has two daughters by her first marriage  —   which ended in 1998, around the time she was heckled in Milan  —   and three stepchildren with her second husband, Tim Jessell, a corporate lawyer Ms. Patchett fixed her up with on a blind date.) If Ms. Fleming had a noticeable talent back then, it was for jazz, still one of her great loves. She was good enough that Illinois Jacquet, the jazz saxophonist, urged her to drop out and tour with his group. She declined, she says, because she was too much of a nerd and afraid of that much freedom. Instead she stayed in school and, always an overachiever, kept applying for and winning fellowships: ones from the Eastman School of Music and the Juilliard School, and a Fulbright that took her to Germany. Fortunate in her teachers, among them Beverley Johnson and the imperious Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, she acquired a formidable mastery of the mechanics of singing. Even now, listening to her talk about breath control, tongue tension and laryngeal placement is enough to make you wonder how anyone ever learned to sing at all. But even with all her technique  —   or maybe because of it  —   Ms. Fleming was a late bloomer. She suffered from stage fright, from poor audition choices and from finding a certain psychological comfort in finishing second rather than first place in competitions. For a while, she sang practically anything: for example, 10   roles in a   stretch starting in 1995. But in the period after that, guided by Mr. Epstein and Ms. Falcone, she made the crucial decision to be more selective and focus on parts that particularly suited her voice. As it happened, many of them were roles in which she wouldn’t have to do battle with the looming legacy of Maria Callas and other great divas of the past: Massenet’s Thaïs and Manon Desdemona in Verdi’s “Otello” the title role in Dvorak’s “Rusalka” (an opera that was practically   until Ms. Fleming brought it back into the repertory) Tatiana in “Eugene Onegin” and the Marschallin. She has been so affecting in these last two that you begin to suspect some deep personal connection to the parts: the shy, spurned lover who never gets over her youthful passion, and the aging mistress. Ms. Fleming has said that it’s unlikely she will ever be poisoned or strangled to death in real life (or become a   mermaid, for that matter) but that “playing out the Marschallin’s grief, her fears and finally, her heartbreaking dignity  —   those are the moments when I feel most exposed. ” If Ms. Fleming has a model besides Leontyne Price, it’s surely Beverly Sills. Her popularity, at its peak even greater than Ms. Fleming’s, was based on the same formula  —   humble roots, hard work, unaffected approachability, the kind of voice you didn’t need to know a thing about opera to love  —   and after her retirement from the stage, she went on to become a hugely influential arts administrator and cultural ambassador. As comfortable sitting on panels as standing onstage, Ms. Fleming has lobbied for arts education in schools and is collaborating with the National Institutes of Health on a project to study the effects of music on the brains of people with autism, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and   stress disorder. Her creative consultancy with the Lyric Opera of Chicago, originally intended as a sort of   experiment that might bring Ms. Fleming to that city more often, has grown into something far deeper. The company’s   2015 premiere production of “Bel Canto,” based on Ms. Patchett’s novel, came about mostly through her energy and determination: She proposed the project and then, acting more like an impresario than a diva, lined up all the talent, at one point bringing in a spreadsheet listing some 60 possible composers. (The Peruvian composer Jimmy López eventually got the nod, and the playwright Nilo Cruz wrote the libretto.) She has worked on audience development efforts and has encouraged the company to leaven its operatic offerings with classic musicals. Every couple of months, she spends a week or so in Chicago, attending meetings and giving master classes. Early in February, she was the host of a   event called Chicago Voices, which included classes for young singers on social media,   and marketing. Ms. Fleming taught a session to a group of aspiring high school students, not just encouraging them but also bending over volunteers and squeezing their backs to improve their breathing. Afterward, she presided over a panel discussion, delving into details about the larynx, the importance of hydration and perhaps more about the vocal mucosa than nonsingers really need to know. A little more than 24 hours later, as if to prove the soundness of her theories and her own breathing apparatus, Ms. Fleming took part in a big concert celebrating Chicago singing in all its variety. She was the only one on the bill without roots in the city, and also  —   because this is what opera stars do  —   the only one to appear in three different outfits. She sang a Debussy art song, a   operatic version of “Summertime,” a Sarah Vaughan jazz tune in a duet with Kurt Elling, and, with John Prine, a gently twanging version of the Nashville song “(We’re Not) the Jet Set. ” That Ms. Fleming sang more than any of the other performers doubtless had something to do with the fact that she was the organizer and headliner. But unlike a lot of singers, she also has the range to perform in that many styles. She can sing practically anything, and in about six languages  —   not just opera and art songs, but jazz, pop and standards. Her 2010 rock album, “Dark Hope,” including songs by indie bands like Arcade Fire and Death Cab for Cutie, was an experiment that pleased almost no one. The indie crowd resented her poaching on their turf, while Ms. Fleming’s opera fans complained that, singing more huskily and about two octaves lower than usual, she sounded so little like herself that they couldn’t recognize her. But the album has a certain oddball integrity, and, if nothing else, demonstrated Ms. Fleming’s fearlessness. Her very eclectic most recent record, “Distant Light,” which came out in January, includes Samuel Barber’s “Knoxville: Summer of 1915,” a lovely old chestnut with a text by James Agee some arty Anders Hillborg settings of poems by Mark Strand, who was a friend of Ms. Fleming’s and three Björk songs. These last numbers might be thought an odd choice for an opera singer, but Ms. Fleming pointed out that even her mother, the former music teacher, loves Björk: “She’s so creative, like Lady Gaga even before Lady Gaga. ” Ms. Fleming doesn’t have much interest in becoming a figure like Adelina Patti, the hugely popular   and    opera star who went around, like Cher, giving farewell concerts for 20 years after she “retired. ” What she wants is to keep on singing, a reasonable amount for a reasonable amount of time, and to be a part of whatever happens next. While the prognosis is not particularly good for the   landscape she dominated, she sounded determined and upbeat about the future. On several occasions, she has brought up her fascination with “American Idol,” which she used to watch with her daughter, and said that she wished opera singers were among the contestants. “I feel like we’ve been left out of the conversation, and we have a lot to offer technically,” she said recently. “I guess it’s the ivory tower and all that, but I’m trying to open the door again. I think my contribution now is to think about audience development, about supporting young artists, and the development of the art form. ” She isn’t temperamentally inclined to share her regrets, but on the eve of her farewell she offered a few. “I would have loved to have sung a lot of the heavier repertoire,” she said. “I once had a manager who said ‘You’re never going to make it otherwise.’ Mimì, Butterfly, Tosca, Salome, Elektra: It would have been exciting, but it simply wasn’t for my voice. ” After pausing a moment, she quickly changed the subject to her work at the Lyric Opera. “That opportunity came as a shock, sort of, seven years ago, when the last thing I was thinking about was slowing down,” she said. “Right now I feel like I’m doing everything  —   singing, concertizing, touring, creating new work. I just kind of love doing all these different things. Time will tell. I may never choose to focus more. ”"
344,Why are black church fires associated with hate?,2015-07-02," (CNN) It’s a visceral and involuntary reaction, perhaps even  : A black church burns in the South and our minds race immediately to hatred.  It must be arson. It must be the handiwork of some despicable white supremacist.  That was the sentiment on display across social and traditional media these past two weeks. The NAACP, while acknowledging only three of the recent fires were suspected arsons, called for vigilance, saying the blazes require ”our collective attention.” ”For centuries,   churches have served as the epicenter of survival for many in the   community. As a consequence, these houses of faith have historically been the targets of violence. We will use every tool in our advocacy arsenal to preserve these beloved institutions,” Cornell William Brooks, the group’s president, said in a statement.  Brooks also cited the recent church massacre in South Carolina. On June 17, Dylann Roof allegedly killed nine members of Charleston’s Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church. Four days later, black churches began burning across the South. To date, seven in five states have caught fire.  Are the events linked? It’s unclear, as investigators continue to gather details. Early indications are that most of the fires were not arson, let alone hate crimes.  But that doesn’t mean we haven’t connected the events in our minds, and that colors how we digest news that another   house of worship has gone up in flames, experts say. ”It isn’t unreasonable to speculate that at least some of the black churches are acts of arson, especially coming in the aftermath of the horrific massacre of nine people in a black church,” said Jack Levin, a professor emeritus at Northeastern University who has studied hate crimes for 30 years and serves as   of the Brudnick Center on Violence and Conflict. Post   parallel, After   acts of hatred were high on America’s mind, and violence targeting Muslims and Sikhs, who were assaulted because they were mistaken for Muslims, made for major news.  Fast forward to the 2012 Sikh temple massacre in Oak Creek, Wisconsin, that left six people dead, and the story’s life was much shorter than it might have been 11 years earlier because it didn’t happen against a backdrop of terrorism and retaliatory violence against Muslims, Levin said. ”That episode never got the publicity that the black church in Charleston got. I don’t think it’s that three more people died,” said the sociologist who has written more than 30 books, including ”Why We Hate.” Mohamad   an assistant professor of philosophy at Florida Gulf Coast University, said he, too, felt the firebombing of mosques and Sikh temples after   led people to jump to ”the conclusion that these acts must not be random.” He took Levin’s thought a step further and said we are so shaken by acts of terrorism, that every shooting or bombing conjures the possibility of a terrorist act, at least initially, before the facts start rolling in. The reason is human nature, he said, explaining that our minds demand answers, and not just any answers. We like causal explanations. We seek to assign blame, even if it’s to something abstract like mental illness, greed or racism. Saying there is no agent that brought about an event    or that lightning caused a church fire    leaves us feeling rudderless,   said.  ”We often feel more frustration when there’s no reason for an event,” he said. ”An explanation always fills that void of having no answers.” This is not the case solely with church fires or terrorism, he said. We look for reasons to explain anything, whether it’s why our friends aren’t talking to us or why we had a rough patch during our childhoods. The need for answers can often override reason, he said,  ”Any explanation is better than no explanation,”   said, paraphrasing philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche. Where does evidence point? In its search for scapegoats, the court of public opinion often jumps to assumptions based on experiences, emotions, bias or evidence    be it good, bad or misconstrued. With the church fires,   said, reason tells us the modus operandi for those trying to incite fear would be to take credit or make themselves known or at least leave some indication such as a swastika or racial pejorative to make their intentions clear    none of which has surfaced yet.  Still, we want to assign blame, and the recent streak of racial strife in the country serves only to make our assumptions that hatred sparked the church fires more plausible, he said.  History does not support the impulse to assume fires at black churches are acts of hate. For one, church and funeral property fires have been on the decline for decades, from about 3, 500 in 1980 to about 1, 700 in 2011, the latest figure available from the National Fire Protection Association. Of the average 1, 780 fires annually between 2007 and 2011, 16% of those were ruled intentional, the NFPA reports.  Insurance scams, vandalism and burglary coverups make up a large percentage of intentional fires, so the number of intentional fires that are arson    and then, the number that targeted only black churches    make up a fraction of that 16% said Marty Ahrens, the NFPA’s senior manager for fire analysis services.  She also noted that roughly half those arrested for arson are younger than 18, leading her to believe the fires were more likely youthful indiscretion or stupidity than they were acts of hatred. Plus, someone might have other reasons for targeting a church aside from the race of its members.  ”There’s a whole host of motivations for arson in any setting, but a place of worship does represent authority to some people, and it’s a powerful symbol in a community,” she said.  Indeed, churches report threats all the time, and Clarendon County, South Carolina, Sheriff Randy Garrett said that before and after the Charleston shooting, five African Methodist Episcopal churches received threatening letters because women headed their congregations. A suspect is in custody, he said. ’The heart of black American life’ But while churches can be targeted for a variety of reasons,   writer and activist David Love said he believes the black church provides a particularly alluring target for those desiring to strike fear in  .  Writing for the historically black newspaper Atlanta Blackstar last week, Love noted that since the days of slavery and through the civil rights movement, white supremacists have targeted black churches because of what they stand for: ”a pillar of the black community, the center for leadership and institution building, education, social and political development and organizing to fight oppression. Strike at the black church, and you strike at the heart of black American life.” So, it makes sense that even though only one in about six church fires is ruled intentional    and even fewer are hate crimes    suspicions would spike each time an   church is reduced to cinders. In that way, Love said during a phone interview, white supremacists have succeeded. ”That’s the goal, is to instill fear and to draw attention so that people don’t forget,” he said. ”It may not be arson now, but people look at the cases where it actually did happen and feel, ’It could happen again.’ ” It’s a natural reaction, he added, ”because of the potent political message it sends when groups such as the Klan commit these acts. That explains the visceral reaction.” There is also the matter of the church Dylann Roof victimized, which has a long history of activism, Love said. Not only was the church a popular spot for civil rights leaders during the 1960s    once hosting the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.    but if you go back to antebellum times, it was burned to the ground in 1822 when a slave revolt was exposed.  Concurring with Levin’s point, Love said the recent police killings of black men and the heated debate over the Confederate flag have likely made people more vigilant    and quick to assume racism is at play    when they see a black church reduced to cinders, but America’s checkered history on race relations goes deeper.  It doesn’t help that the authorities investigating the church fires belong to some of the same governments that historically oppressed black people    whether it was failing to protect rights, turning a blind eye to Klan violence or actively spying on and infiltrating groups fighting for equality during the civil rights movement, he said. ”All of it is connected, and it speaks to a lack of trust between police and the community,” he said. This church, that church, Levin agreed, saying, ”Part of that history has to be discussed when we consider why a black church would be the focal point of so much angst.” After all, he said, it was the local law enforcement agencies who ”brought the dogs to Selma and Montgomery.” This isn’t the first time the public has been quick to assume bigots were burning churches. A rash of church fires in the 1990s    many of which were thought to be racially motivated by the National Council of Churches    spurred President Bill Clinton to create the National Church Arson Task Force.  It turned out that dozens of the fires had been set by Jay Scott Ballinger, a   ”missionary of Lucifer” whose beef lay with Christianity in general, no matter a church’s demographics. The majority, Levin said, had been committed by teenagers ”looking for a thrill,” and the incidence of church arson coincided with an    spike in crime committed by young people.  With the recent fires, geography is very much playing into people’s assumptions, Levin said. Seven black churches have burned across the South, and those churches have dominated media coverage of the issue.  Two other churches    College Heights Baptist Church in Elyria, Ohio, and the Forerunners for Christ Church in the Echo Park neighborhood of Los Angeles    have burned since June 21 as well, but drew far less media coverage. The Echo Park blaze is being investigated as an arson, according to CNN affiliate KABC. Those churches just don’t fit the narrative, Levin said.  ”The publicity was concentrated in a certain area of the country    the South. We’re talking about Southern black churches. It’s these three variables together that have created a strong reaction in the media and also among the public,” he said. "
345,Tamir Rice report: No proof officer warned before shots,2015-06-14," (CNN) The Cuyahoga County Sheriff’s Department on Saturday released an investigation report in the Cleveland police shooting of    Tamir Rice. While offering no opinion whether two officers should be prosecuted, the report reveals new detail about the shooting. A city police officer shot and killed Rice on November 22. A citizen had called the 911 center to report  a ”guy with a pistol” outside a city recreation center, but the responding officers weren’t told the caller said the gun might be ”fake” and the guy might be a juvenile. Rice actually had a pellet gun. Will the officer and his partner be charged? On Thursday a judge said he thought there was probable cause, but his opinion is not binding. A grand jury will study this investigation report and decide whether to indict.  Here are some of the report’s major takeaways: It’s unclear whether officer shouted warnings before shooting, The police department has said Officer Timothy Loehmann ”shouted verbal commands” from inside his patrol car before firing at Rice, but the report says witness interviews don’t back up that statement. Loehmann and his partner, Frank Garmback, didn’t talk to the sheriff’s office investigators. The patrol car didn’t have a dashboard camera and security video cameras at the recreation center don’t have audio. One woman who lives nearby said she heard two popping sounds, then shouting, then a third popping sound. Loehmann only fired two shots, however. Police didn’t immediately render first aid to Rice, An FBI agent happened to be in the area following up a bank robbery, heard about the incident and arrived about three minutes after the shooting. He found Rice lying on the ground. The two officers appeared upset and   he said, wanting to help Rice but not knowing what to do. The agent, a national registered paramedic who’d served in the military, tried to stop the bleeding and got assistance from an officer when he asked for it. Janell Rutherford, supervisor for patrols in that area, said patrol cars were not equipped with   kits and officers had no   training beyond basic CPR. All the officers thought Rice was older than 12, The initial call to 911 described a male with a gun at the recreation center, who might have been a juvenile.  Officers at the scene said they thought Rice was   and the FBI agent said he first thought Rice was ”” based on his size. Rice was 5 feet 7 and weighed 195 pounds, according to the autopsy. The agent said he heard Rice’s sister screaming that he was only 12 years old. The agent said, ”I remember thinking to myself, I’m like, ’There’s no way.’ And I looked at his face, I’m like, ’Yeah.’ He’s got a   face. . ..”  The air pistol looked very real, police said, Rice traded a cell phone to a friend for the pistol. The friend told investigators he’d taken the air pistol apart and couldn’t refasten the orange tip that distinguishes air pistols from real ones. The gun is listed as a ”replica firearm,” a Colt 1911 target pistol that’s 11. 25 inches long. One officer said it looked ”a thousand percent real.” Rice talked to the FBI agent before dying, ”I asked him his name which he replied to me    told me, and then he said that he was shot and he made a reference to his, uh, regarding like a gun or a question like, ’Where’s my gun?’ . .. I can’t remember exactly what it was. I just remembered that he made reference to a firearm.” Loehmann talked to the FBI agent, Though he didn’t talk to Cuyahoga County investigators, Loehmann talked briefly to the FBI agent while he sat in a patrol car nursing an ankle injured during the shooting at the rec center. Loehmann said, ”He [Rice] had a gun and he reached for it,” according to the agent. Rice was shot at close range, Loehmann fired from a distance of 4. 5 to 7 feet from Rice. The patrol car rolled onto the grass at the Cudell Recreation Center and Loehmann exited the vehicle and fired twice within two seconds.  Cleveland police were investigating the shooting, but amid calls for an independent investigation, the Cuyahoga County Sheriff’s Department was brought in. Many of the interviews with witnesses were conducted in March, more than three months after Rice was killed."

June 9, 2013   Booz Allen Hamilton releases a statement confirming that Snowden has been an employee of their firm for almost three months.  June 12, 2013   The South China Morning Post publishes an interview with Snowden in which he says that US intelligence agents have been hacking networks around the world for years.  June 17, 2013   During a live online chat, the person identified as Snowden by Britain’s Guardian newspaper insists that US authorities have access to phone calls,   and other communications far beyond constitutional bounds.  June 18, 2013   Testifying before the House Intelligence Committee, FBI Deputy Director Sean Joyce argues that the PRISM program has helped stop a number of alleged terrorist attacks.  June 21, 2013   Federal prosecutors unseal a complaint filed in US District Court in Virginia on June 14, 2013, charging Snowden with espionage and theft of government property.  June 22, 2013   A senior US administration official says the United States has contacted authorities in Hong Kong to seek the extradition of Snowden.  June 23, 2013   Snowden flies to Moscow from Hong Kong. Russian President Vladimir Putin later verifies that Snowden is in the transit area of Moscow’s Sheremetyevo International Airport.  June 23, 2013   A source tells CNN that the US government has revoked Snowden’s passport.  June 30, 2013   German news magazine Der Spiegel reports that classified leaks by Snowden detail NSA bugging of European Union offices in Washington and New York, as well as an EU building in Brussels.  July 12, 2013   Snowden meets with human rights activists and lawyers. He says he is requesting asylum from Russia while he awaits safe passage to Latin America. July 16, 2013   Russian lawyer Anatoly Kucherena tells CNN that Snowden has applied for temporary asylum in Russia. If his request is granted, Snowden would be able to live in Russia for at least a year.  July 24, 2013   Russian news media reports that Russia has approved documents that would allow Snowden to enter the rest of the country while his temporary asylum request is considered.  August 1, 2013   Kucherena tells CNN that Snowden’s application for political asylum for a year has been approved and he has left the Moscow airport.  October 31, 2013   Snowden’s attorney Kucherena tells CNN that his client has been hired by an unnamed Russian website.  November 3, 2013   A letter, purportedly written by Snowden, is published in the German magazine Der Spiegel. The letter, titled ”A Manifesto for the Truth” says, ”mass surveillance is a global problem and needs a global solution.” December 17, 2013   Snowden posts an open letter to Brazil, offering to help investigate US surveillance of Brazilian citizens. January 23, 2014   Attorney General Eric Holder says, ”If Mr. Snowden wanted to come back to the United States and enter a plea, we would engage with his lawyers.” Snowden says in an online chat the same day that,” (a return to the US is) unfortunately not possible in the face of current   protection laws.” March 10, 2014   Snowden speaks via teleconference from Russia to an audience of thousands at the South by Southwest Interactive Festival in Austin, Texas, urging the audience to help ”fix” the US government’s surveillance of its citizens. The event marks the first time Snowden has directly addressed people in the United States since he fled the country with thousands of secret documents last June. May 28, 2014   NBC News airs an interview with Snowden in which he claims, ”I was trained as a spy in sort of the traditional sense of the word    in that I lived and worked undercover, overseas, pretending to work in a job that I’m not    and even being assigned a name that was not mine.” In an interview with Wolf Blitzer, National Security Adviser Susan Rice denies that Snowden was ever a US spy.  August 7, 2014   Snowden’s attorney announces that Snowden has been granted an extension to stay in Russia for three more years.  February 23, 2015   NSA Director Adm. Michael Rogers says that Snowden’s surveillance leaks have had a ”material impact” on the agency’s ability to prevent and detect terror plots.  June 4, 2015   In response to President Barack Obama signing the USA Freedom Act that will limit our nation’s surveillance on private citizens, Snowden publishes an   piece in The New York Times saying ”ending the mass surveillance of private phone calls under the Patriot Act is a historic victory for the rights of every citizen. ..” July 28, 2015   The White House rejects a petition to pardon Snowden and maintains its position that Snowden should return to the United States. The petition contains over 167, 000 signatures supporting Snowden. September 29, 2015   Snowden joins Twitter and gains over 110, 000 followers in less than an hour after posting his first tweet. Snowden only follows the NSA. October 5, 2015   According to Snowden, he is willing to go to prison if he is allowed to return to the United States. Snowden and his lawyers are waiting to discuss a deal with the US government. May 30, 2016   Former US Attorney General Eric Holder says Snowden performed a ”public service” by triggering a debate over surveillance techniques, but still must pay a penalty for illegally leaking a trove of classified intelligence documents. September 16, 2016   The film ”Snowden,” directed by Oliver Stone, opens in US theaters. December 22, 2016   Congress releases a report saying Snowden has been in contact with Russian intelligence officials since arriving in Russia. Snowden immediately takes to Twitter following the report’s release to dispute the accusations, writing ”they claim without evidence that I’m in cahoots with the Russians.” January 17, 2017   Russia extends Snowden’s asylum until 2020."

349,Redstone’s Lawyers Argue That His Mental Health Is Irrelevant in Dispute - The New York Times,2016-11-11,"In an unexpected twist in an already tumultuous legal fight, lawyers for Sumner M. Redstone argued in court filings on Friday that the competency of the ailing    mogul did not matter in the dispute over his $40 billion media empire. Regardless of whether or not Mr. Redstone had the mental capacity to oust two longtime confidants from the trust that will control his companies after he dies or is declared incompetent, the outcome would have been the same, his lawyers said. According to the filing, at least four of the seven trustees have supported and validated Mr. Redstone’s decision two weeks ago to oust Philippe P. Dauman, the chairman and chief of Viacom, and George S. Abrams, a longtime Viacom director, from the trust and the board of National Amusements, the private theater chain company through which Mr. Redstone controls Viacom and CBS. “Plaintiffs miscalculated not only Sumner’s resolve, but also the commitment of their fellow trustees to do the right thing,” Mr. Redstone’s lawyers said in the document, filed in Norfolk Probate and Family Court in Massachusetts. The revelation that a majority of trustees have ratified Mr. Redstone’s decision could present a significant blow to Mr. Dauman and Mr. Abrams in the   corporate battle they are waging for control of Mr. Redstone’s vast corporate holdings. It also presents a major victory for Shari Redstone, Mr. Redstone’s once ostracized, recently reconciled daughter, who has opposed Mr. Dauman’s leadership of Viacom. Les Fagen, a lawyer for Mr. Dauman and Mr. Abrams, said in a statement that “many undisclosed facts that will emerge concerning the conduct of Shari and her representatives. ” Mr. Fagen added that Friday’s court filings revealed that some trustees “have not seen Sumner for as long as ‘many years. ’” The court filing depicts Mr. Dauman and Mr. Abrams as partaking in a monthslong scheme, starting in the beginning of 2016, to betray Mr. Redstone out of the fear that Mr. Dauman would be fired. The document asserted that Mr. Dauman and Mr. Abrams, along with another trustee, retained a Boston law firm in late January for advice on what recourse they had if Mr. Redstone ousted them from the trust. The advice from the law firm was that the three men could avoid or contest their dismissal if they could prove that Mr. Redstone was incompetent and that he was manipulated by Ms. Redstone. “Road map in hand, plaintiffs no longer felt accountable even to Sumner as Viacom’s controlling shareholder,” the document states. The dismissals of Mr. Dauman and Mr. Abrams from the trust and the National Amusements board were viewed by industry observers as a harbinger of the firing of the Viacom board and, ultimately, the removal of Mr. Dauman as chief executive. Mr. Dauman and Mr. Abrams filed suit in Massachusetts, where the trust was settled, seeking to immediately block the moves. The suit challenges Mr. Redstone’s mental capacity, depicting him as suffering “profound physical and mental illness” and being subject to the undue influence of Ms. Redstone. It asserts that Mr. Redstone cannot read, write, do arithmetic or speak coherently. For their part, lawyers for Mr. Redstone filed a separate petition requesting that a Los Angeles court validate his decision. On Tuesday morning, Judge George F. Phelan of the Norfolk County Probate and Family Court in Massachusetts is scheduled to oversee a hearing on the motion by Mr. Dauman and Mr. Abrams to expedite the proceedings in the case. In the court filings on Friday, lawyers for Mr. Redstone asked that the judge reject the request to expedite proceedings and said that they planned to move to dismiss the case. They cited the agreement by a majority of the trustees to ratify the decision to oust Mr. Dauman and Mr. Abrams from the trust. Mr. Redstone’s lawyers also argued that the case should be heard by a judge in Los Angeles, where Mr. Redstone lives and took the action to remove Mr. Dauman and Mr. Abrams from the trust. The question of Mr. Redstone’s mental capacity remains in dispute. Mr. Redstone’s lawyers argued that the trust outlined specific procedures to determine incapacity and that those had not been activated at the time when Mr. Dauman and Mr. Abrams were dismissed. They cited the results of two recent exams by a geriatric psychiatrist hired by Mr. Redstone that concluded he had “legal mental capacity” and was not under the influence of others. On Thursday, Mr. Fagen said that the exam had been conducted by a “paid medical consultant and does not answer the question of whether Sumner Redstone had sufficient capacity. ”"
350,Klukowski: Trump’s Supreme Court List a ’Conservative Goldmine’ - Breitbart,2016-05-21,"Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump took a big step toward rallying GOP conservatives around his candidacy with his list of potential Supreme Court picks, Breitbart News Legal Editor Ken Klukowski told Executive Chairman Stephen K. Bannon on Breitbart News Daily on Sirius XM Patriot 125. [The Supreme Court became a   issue in the 2016 election with the untimely passing of Justice Antonin Scalia, a legendary hero to constitutional conservatives and a towering intellect on the nation’s highest court.  Trump released his   list of potential picks to succeed Justice Scalia, naming eleven individuals as his starting point to fill Scalia’s seat, and Bannon went through Klukowski’s written analysis of Trump’s list.  Responding favorably to the names put forward by Trump, Klukowski began, “This list includes some incredible conservatives, from Diane Sykes on the federal Seventh Circuit, to Tom Lee on the Utah Supreme Court, to David Straus on the Minnesota Supreme Court, to Don Willet on the Texas Supreme Court. ” The list included three former law clerks of Justice Clarence Thomas, the most conservative justice currently serving on the Supreme Court. Trump later told the public that he was going to add names to the list, which led some optimistic conservative legal experts to hope that he would add names such as Senator Ted Cruz, Senator Mike Lee, or former U. S. Solicitor General Paul Clement. This later statement from Trump also led some of his conservative critics to speculate that the presumptive Republican nominee would be adding names that conservatives would oppose, or that if elected to the White House he would ignore his own list, noting that his statement releasing the list said the list was a “guide” to picking a justice, and that he later added he would pick either from that list or other people very similar to those on the list. But Klukowski regarded Trump’s list as a very positive development that would help unify the Republican Party behind the businessman, telling Bannon: The Supreme Court has always been extremely important, on issues that belong in court such as the Second Amendment, Obamacare, and immigration. But conservatives have always understood that once the Supreme Court started in 1965 hijacking political issues that are not in the Constitution, such as abortion and marriage —  overriding the will of the voters through judicial activism —  that now if you have a liberal Supreme Court, the Court can shut down democracy anytime it wants by declaring something to be a constitutional issue   …     and so no issue is more important than a president’s nominations for the High Court.

351,A historically popular senator’s approval ratings are tanking after blocking Obama’s Supreme Court nominee,2016-05-03,"’’ ”Sen. Chuck Grassley’s ( ) approval rating among Iowa voters has taken a hit since Senate Republicans said they would refuse to consider President Obama’s Supreme Court nominee, according to a new poll commissioned by liberal groups and released to  on Monday.” ”Just 42 percent of voters had a positive view of the historically popular Iowa senator, according to the poll, which was commissioned by the Constitutional Responsibility Project, a group pushing for the Senate to consider Merrick Garland’s nomination, and the League of Conservation Voters. The polling was conducted by Hart Research Associates.” ”Grassley’s approval is still relatively high, but in a Hart Research Associates poll from two years ago, 60 percent of voters had a positive reaction to Grassley. In a  conducted shortly after the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia’s death in February showed Grassley earning 57 percent of Iowa voters’ approval.” ”The   senator has long been popular in his state, but he may be more  in 2016 due to the Senate Republican blockade of Obama’s Supreme Court nominee and the potential for Donald Trump to become the party’s presidential nominee. As the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, the committee in charge of hearings for judicial nominees, Grassley has become the unlikely  for Republicans’ bid to stop Obama from appointing a Supreme court justice. Democrats have recruited former Lt. Gov. Patty Judge to challenge Grassley for his Senate seat.” ’According to the new poll, 43 percent of Iowa voters have a less favorable view of Grassley due to news coverage of the Supreme Court blockade, while 23 percent have a more favorable view of the senator.’ ’Hart Research Associates surveyed 501 Iowa voters via phone from April   with a margin of error 4. 5 percentage points.’ ”Sen.

352,Trump Launches TV Ad About Clinton’s ’50 Points Ahead’ Question - Breitbart,2016-09-30,"Donald Trump’s campaign is running a television ad critiquing Hillary Clinton for asking an audience why she isn’t 50 points ahead of the Republican nominee. [The ad is titled, “Why?” and is running nationally.  “Hillary Clinton’s career is a   highlight reel of moments in which Clinton puts her   over the needs of everyday Americans,” Trump’s senior communications adviser Jason Miller states in a press release announcing the ad. He continued: To be clear, Hillary Clinton is in this race to enrich herself and line the pockets of her Wall Street donors. Why is out of touch Hillary Clinton not 50 points ahead? The answer is pretty clear. Voters want a change in direction and only Donald J. Trump can provide that change. The ad’s voiceover answers Clinton’s question about why she isn’t 50 points ahead of Trump by reminding Americans that the FBI director found Clinton lied about her emails, alleged that ISIS and terrorism has spread under her watch and that she called many Americans “deplorables. ”  "

354,Petraeus sentenced: 2 years probation $100K fine,2015-04-23,"Washington (CNN) Gen. David Petraeus, once a widely celebrated military leader who oversaw operations in Afghanistan and Iraq and was touted as a potential presidential candidate, was sentenced to serve two years on probation and to pay an $100, 000 fine on Thursday for sharing classified information with his biographer and lover, Paula Broadwell. ”Today marks the end of a      ordeal,” Petraeus said outside the Charlotte federal courthouse following his sentencing. ”I now look forward to moving on with the next phase of my life.” Petraeus, who resigned as director of the Central Intelligence Agency in November 2012 after the relationship became public, avoided jail time as part of a plea deal. Prosecutors agreed to not send Petraeus to jail because the classified information was never released to the public or published in the biography of him that Broadwell wrote. Some of his supporters believe that he can recover his reputation    and argue in some ways, he already has. ”I don’t want to wallow in 2012, and luckily neither has he,” said Michael O’Hanlon, a close friend of Petraeus and a scholar at the Brookings Institution. READ: FBI agent testifies in Paula Broadwell cyberstalking case, Armed with a Ph. D, Petraeus rose to military brass and led United States Central Command and later all forces in Afghanistan as the war there petered out. He retired from the military to lead the CIA at the request of President Barack Obama in 2011. But after only about a year, Petraeus delivered Obama a resignation letter, sinking into shame as the news that his   chronicler was actually his lover. Petraeus spent some time maintaining a low profile, but then began to emerge in   accepting positions at universities and the private equity giant Kohlberg Kravis Roberts. Most of Petraeus’ friends and family    including his wife, Holly    have been supportive of the   general and stood by him, friends of Petraeus said, though no Petraeus family members joined him in court on Thursday. ”The world has deemed it clear that we recognize that we’re all human,” said O’Hanlon.  John Duffield, a friend of Petraeus from his graduate school years at Princeton University, described the past few years as ”painful to watch,” especially given how much promise the general had even beyond his already impressive resume. ”It didn’t seem like he had reached the apogee of his career,” said Duffield, who added Petraeus may yet rehabilitate his reputation. ”I don’t know if it’ll be relegated to a footnote, but maybe only one chapter in a lengthy book of accomplishments.”  SEE: Petraeus still advises White House, That rebranding is made easier thanks to a plea deal that allowed Petraeus to escape jail time by paying $40, 000 and serving two years on probation. But a federal judge on Thursday in Charlotte, North Carolina instead ordered him to pay $100, 000 in order to ”reflect the seriousness of the offense.” ”Make no mistake: This is a serious matter,” Judge David Kessler told the courtroom, adding that his actions ”stood in stark contrast to the 37 years of achievement and his remarkable public service.” Petraeus pled guilty in March to one federal charge for giving    inch black notebooks containing some classified information to Broadwell, who wrote ”All in: The Education of General David Petraeus” in 2012. Those notebooks included notes from national security meetings, the identities of covert officers and more classified documents. Some have characterized the agreement, in which Petraeus only pleads guilty to a misdemeanor, as too lenient.  Abbe Lowell, a lawyer who represents a government leaker currently in jail for sharing information with the media, said in a letter to the Justice Department that the deal showed a ”profound double standard.” ”  officials (such as General Petraeus, and, earlier, Leon Panetta) leak classified information to forward their own agendas (or to impress their mistresses) with virtual impunity,” wrote Lowell, referencing Petraeus’ predecessor as CIA director. But Petraeus defenders have called that charge rough on him. ”It’s not like he was giving this to the National Enquirer,” O’Hanlon said, who nevertheless said the behavior ”shouldn’t have happened and shouldn’t be excused.” Now, Petraeus    who had continued to advise the current administration    is perhaps positioning himself for a   return to public leadership in the next one. ”The personal shortcomings ultimately, I would hope, will be seen as in the same light as Grant’s whiskey or Eisenhower’s mistress, or whatever else,” said O’Hanlon, referring to the military leaders’ known foibles. ”The inevitable human dimensions of people who are still great Americans.”  "

357,Trump Blasts ’Democrats’ Fantasy World’ at Packed Iowa Rally,2016-07-28,"Republican nominee Donald Trump dismissed the narrative at the Democratic National Convention (DNC) that America is on track, saying Democrats are living in a “fantasy world. ”[“They’re not talking about the real world,” Trump stated Wednesday night during his campaign rally in Davenport, Iowa. Trump was referencing President Obama’s speech referencing the billionaire and said the Democrats aren’t discussing or acknowledging radical Islamic terrorism, open borders, crime, or real wages.  Trump, in Iowa, says Dems are being overly optimistic about the state of USA. ”I watched last night, and it was like all beautiful roses.”  —   Ashley Killough (@KilloughCNN) July 28, 2016,  “They don’t talk about all of the problems we have in our country with education,” he added. “They’re not talking about Obamacare  …    Obamacare is a catastrophe. ” “You’re going to have increases,” Trump warned about the cost of Obamacare. “It’s   numbers. ” “We want to have those numbers revealed prior to the election on November 8,” he declared, alleging the Obama administration wants the numbers to come out in December. Trump also jabbed Obama over the debt doubling under his watch, adding that’s another issue not being discussed at the DNC. “We can’t go for another four years of Obama,” Trump stated, meaning Hillary Clinton. Trump’s campaign additionally released a press release Thursday evening, bashing the Democrats for their “fantasy world. ” The press release read: At Hillary Clinton’s convention this week, Democrats have been speaking about a world that doesn’t exist. A world where America has full employment, where there’s no such thing as radical Islamic terrorism, where the border is totally secured, and where thousands of innocent Americans have not suffered from rising crime in cities like Baltimore and Chicago. In the Democrats’ fantasy world, there is no problem with Hillary Clinton maintaining an illegal, exposed server full of classified information that could have been hacked by any foreign enemy, and in which Hillary Clinton risked prison time to delete 33, 000 emails that were simply about yoga and wedding planning. In this world, there is no Hillary Clinton disaster in Syria, Libya and Egypt, ISIS doesn’t merit a mention, Iran isn’t on the path to nukes, convention stages don’t need American flags, and our great men and women of law enforcement, our police, do not need to be honored. I propose a different vision for America, one where we can break up Washington’s rigged system, and empower all Americans to achieve their dreams. In our vision, we will put America First. If we deliver this change, the future is limitless and we will Make America Great Again for everyone. During his campaign rally in Davenport, Iowa, Trump appealed directly to Hawkeye state voters by promising to keep Iowa the first in the nation caucus state during the primaries, to aide beef sales regarding trade deals, and to help evangelicals by removing the Johnson Amendment, which silences churches on political issues due to tax exempt status. ”I’m not in love with the caucus system, I have to tell you.

According to the Iowa Beef Industry Council, “In 2014, Iowa’s cattle industry contributed in excess of 7. 4 billion dollars in business activity to Iowa’s economy. ” In addition to the farmers, Trump appealed to evangelicals by promising to remove the Johnson Amendment  —   created by Lyndon Johnson  —   which prevents churches from speaking out on political issues due to tax exempt status. “I figure that’s one way I’m getting to heaven,” Trump joked.

358,Barbra Streisand Says She Will Move to Australia If Trump Becomes President - Breitbart,2016-08-28,"Add Barbra Streisand to the list of celebrities who will be moving out of the United States if Donald Trump is elected president in November. [The    singer and actress told 60 Minutes correspondent Michael Usher on Sunday that she will leave the country if Donald Trump is elected president.  “I worry,” Streisand said during the  interview that aired Sunday, according to the Daily Mail. “I don’t take anything for granted. I want Hillary Clinton to be President of the United States. But there is still a lot of sexism, and ‘A woman being president?’ you know, and making fun of her, the way [Donald Trump] insults her right and left, and has no facts. ” “I can’t believe it. I’m either coming to your country if you’ll let me in, or Canada,” Streisand added, apparently referring to the possibility that Republican Donald Trump could be elected president. “You’re very, very welcome,” the   correspondent told the singer.  Streisand, one of Clinton’s top celebrity backers in the 2016 race for the White House, has been increasingly vocal in her support for the Democratic candidate and increasingly open about her dislike of Republican Donald Trump. The Grammy, Emmy, Oscar and     is set to host an “LGBT for Hillary” dinner fundraiser next month at New York City’s Cipriani Wall Street, with tickets ranging from $1, 200 all the way up to $250, 000. In March, Streisand penned an essay in which she blasted the “outright sexism” in the media’s coverage of Clinton. “Why is it that today even a woman as impressive as Hillary Clinton is judged not by her merits and extensive resume alone, but held to a pernicious double standard?” she wrote in a short essay for the Huffington Post. Last year, Streisand called the prospect of a Trump presidency “terrifyingly scary. ” Streisand is just one of nearly a dozen celebrities who have publicly vowed to move out of the United States in the event that Trump is elected. Other stars who have made the same pledge include Whoopi Goldberg, Miley Cyrus, Samuel L. Jackson, George Lopez,   and Cher. Streisand’s latest album, Encore: Movie Partners Sing Broadway, was released August 26.   Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum"

[MILO beat Vice   Mike Pence for the top vote, receiving 70, 000 votes, over 80% of all votes. Pence also received a formidable 23, 000 votes.    LGBTQ Nation say interview with MILO will be released next week. In their announcement of the award, LGBTQ Nation noted some of the allegedly “awful” reasons why MILO made the news in 2016, before acknowledging the Breitbart senior editor’s ability to influence the news cycle.  Yiannopoulos made the news throughout 2016 and always for truly awful reasons. He was a queer cheerleader for Donald Trump, whom he called “Daddy. ” He has harassed and demeaned transgender people repeatedly. Hate him or love him, one thing Yiannopoulos truly excels at is getting attention for himself and his causes. If he decides to highlight an issue, his fans will follow his every word on the subject and more often than not, it’ll get moved to a mainstream audience as the story picks up steam from online chatter. For a gay guy from Britain, he has truly made his mark on conservative American politics and entertainment. He’s been able to brand himself the ultimate gay provocateur in a year of provocateurs. Yiannopoulos, however, wanted to add to his list of accomplishments in 2016, telling LGBTQ Nation his list included, “My banishment from Twitter, recently announced book deal (  now!)   college tour, my jawline, and a really cute Siberian fox  sable fur I just snapped up. ” LGBTQ Nation’s editorial staff added a note to the article indicating they removed a reference to MILO as a member of the   movement.

360,French Media Censor Identities Of Terrorists - ’To Avoid Glorification’,2016-07-28,"Major French media outlets  —   including Le Monde  —   have decided to stop publishing photographs and names of terrorists in a move that could become enshrined in French law. [Several major media outlets in France have decided to stop publishing the pictures of Islamic terrorists, some even censoring their names altogether.  The editorial boards of the television news network BFMTV, and newspapers Le Monde and Le Parisien have decided that they will no longer publish the photographs of Islamic terrorists. They all uniformly state that the reason is to “avoid glorification” of the jihadists after their deaths. In an editorial on Wednesday, director of Le Monde, Jerome Fenoglio, announced that the newspaper will not publish pictures of jihadists who have slain French men and women. He stated: “Following the Nice attack, we will no longer publish the photographs of perpetrators [of terrorism] in order to avoid possible posthumous glorification. ”   also made the move today by not airing photographs of Adel Kermiche, the jihadist who beheaded a priest in Normandy. Another newspaper, Le Croix, has taken it a step further by not only censoring images of terrorists but by identifying them by first name and initial, only. However, broadcaster Europe 1 has come out and said that it would neither reveal the picture nor name of future perpetrators of terror  —   redacting entirely jihadists’ identities. The broadcaster tweeted that it would not “make heroes” of the terrorists. @Europe1 ne citera plus les noms des terroristes à l’antenne pour ne pas en faire des héros, décision de la direction de la radio.  —   SDR_Europe1 (@SDR_Europe1) July 27, 2016,  The   have not stated whether this censorship of details will be rolled out to include all perpetrators of violent crime  —   such as serial killers or mass murders  —   or whether this practice will be isolated to those acts attributed to Islamic terrorism alone. Rising star of the populist right Marion Le Pen of the Front National reacted angrily to the media outlets’ decision, questioning whether the   of the names and photographs of Islamist terrorists served the purpose to hide terrorism’s link to immigration, a relationship that other European politicians like Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán and Poland’s Interior Minister Mariusz Blaszczak is not afraid to make. Les médias annoncent l’  des noms et photos des terroristes islamistes : pour mieux cacher le lien avec l’immigration ?  —   Marion Le Pen (@Marion_M_Le_Pen) July 27, 2016,  However, not all major media outlets made pronounced declarations of  . francetélévisions has decided to continue to identify the terrorists. In a statement by the director, Michel Field asserted: “We have not waited for the recent events to adopt an ethical and responsible course of action in the treatment of terrorist horror. And we do not need statements or postures  …    to do our work. ” Evoking the “perverse effect” of terrorist anonymisation: “Anonymous attacks, nameless and faceless perpetrators? Nothing better to provoke conspiracy theories, and promote a social anxiety from a population who already suspect that the media not always tells, or will want to silence, the truth. ” However, whereas at this point media outlets are voluntarily   controlled media may soon be enshrined into French law. Juliette Méadel, member of the Socialist party and the Secretary of State for victim support, announced that she has launched a working group that will propose the next steps on “rethink[ing] the ethics of the media” in their coverage of domestic terror attacks committed in the name of Islam. Ms. Méadel in an interview with Metro News said: “The principle of freedom of information is essential. We must be informed of what is happening” but at the same time believes “we must think of ways to provide information without necessarily delivering all the details of the identity or the biography of the terrorist”. This is what the Secretary of State terms “responsible journalism”. Working with the Secretary of State for digital media, and the Ministry of Culture and Communication, Ms. Méadel’s goal is to make proposals by September of this year, her aim to “convince and ensure that all the media and ‘Gafa’ [Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon] agree on ethics”. This is not the first time that a European government official has colluded with media corporations such as Facebook in the policing of information. Breitbart London reported that in May of this year Facebook had signed a European Union pledge to suppress ‘hate speech’ and promote ‘counter narratives’. This came after the German government’s demand that social media giants Google, Facebook, and Twitter remove what it called   ‘hate speech’ from their platforms. However, Cedric Rouquette, the director of studies at the Journalists Training Centre (CFJ) in France, questioned the feasibility of such legislation: “Even if there are financial penalties for   with the proposed ban, the media will always prefer to pay and publish what is real information for the purpose of understanding  —   and certainly not to glorify. ” The French media withholding the identities of terrorists from the public is reminiscent of Swedish police sending out a memo to all its officers ordering them not to release descriptions of crime suspects which include race or nationality to avoid accusations of racism."
361,A top medical institution ran a secret study on Theranos — here’s what it found,2016-03-29,"’’ ’Medical researchers have finally gone and run the study on   startup  that observers have been waiting for.’ ’A team from the  took a group of volunteers to have their blood tested at Theranos. To evaluate the results, they ran the same tests at Quest and LabCorp, the two companies that have long dominated   testing.’ ’The team behind the study says that they found issues with certain Theranos tests, but that in other cases Theranos test results were roughly equivalent to the results from the other two major labs.’ ”Once the subject of adoring media coverage, Elizabeth Holmes’ company has come under fire as serious doubts have surfaced about  along with .” ’Many commenters have asked ”Why not just walk in, get a blood test, and compare the results?” But comparing the accuracy of new tests to existing lab services is more complicated than that. You need to run hundreds or thousands of tests before you can really assess how accurate a diagnostic test is.’ ”So when this group of medical researchers who specialize in understanding big data wanted to know how good Theranos’ tests were and realized that there was no data, they decided to run a study on Theranos themselves.” ’”It got odd, to the point that it’’s like, ’’Well, that’’s really weird,’’” says Eric Schadt, the founding director of the Icahn Institute at Mount Sinai. So he says that he and coauthor Joel Dudley decided: ”Let’’s do the test. ”’ ’They published their results on March 28 .’ ’Schadt says that certain Theranos tests regularly returned results that were far enough off that they could result in unnecessary clinical decisions, affecting patient care and medical research.’ ’But he says that for many of the things they tested, Theranos results were ”much more in line with the others than they are out of line. ”’ ’Even more interestingly, he says that ”there was as much variability between LabCorp and Quest as there was between Theranos and LabCorp or Theranos and Quest. ”’ ’In other words, Theranos has problems, but no blood test is perfect and the labs that people have long used frequently return results with some degree of variation.’ ”Theranos disputes the study’s findings.” ’Daniel Young, a Theranos vice president and lab director of the company’’s Scottsdale facility, tells Tech Insider that it’’s still compiling a list of issues that it has with the study. But he says that ”we believe that some basic factors in the way the samples were collected could account for some of the differences that we’’re seeing. ”’ ’Schadt, Dudley, a group from Mount Sinai, and one Arizona researcher recruited 60 healthy adult volunteers. They selected 22 common lab tests that they knew Theranos would administer with just a finger prick, in theory taking advantage of the microfluidic technology that first made the company famous for running tests on just a single drop of blood.’ ’’ ”They didn’t talk to Theranos about what they planned to do before the study. Schadt says they decided against it at the time because they didn’t want to give the impression that the company was influencing the results.” ’They ran the study between July 27 and July 31 of 2015, when Theranos  for tests other than its one   test for herpes.’ ”The team split the 60 volunteers, 33 women and 27 men who ranged in age from 19 to 71, into groups of about five. On testing days, volunteers didn’t eat and avoided exercise, so as not to influence results. Coordinators took them to a   Walgreens with a Theranos testing center inside. They took several samples of each individual’s blood outside and took the individuals inside to get the full suite of 22 tests. Then they went to another Walgreens Theranos location and repeated the process.” ’At one point, Schadt says that their New York team got a call from their Arizona coordinator, saying that a Theranos executive had shown up to ask why they were running so many tests.’ ’But at the time, since they wanted to finish testing before tipping the company off, they said that they were part of a wellness institute that was focused on using testing to better understand health. Schadt says they even checked results that came in after the interruption to see if testing had become more precise in some way, but there were no observable changes.’ ’The team drew enough blood from volunteers to have reference labs Quest and LabCorp run three tests for each individual Theranos test. The study included a total of 2, 640 Theranos results and 7, 920 results each for Quest and LabCorp  —   enough, Schadt says, to compare the results to each other.’ ’For most blood tests, results vary day to day, so there’’s a range where results are considered ”normal.” The study found that Theranos was 1. 6 times as more likely to find results outside those ranges than either LabCorp or Quest, reporting results either above or below a normal range 12. 2% of the time, compared to 8. 3% of the time for LabCorp and 7. 5% of the time for Quest.’ ’’ ”It is worth pointing out that  found that not all drops of blood extracted using just a finger prick are exactly the same. Some give different results for blood tests than others, which could explain some of Theranos’ variation but also raises new questions about how feasible   blood tests are.” ”Theranos was more likely to reject blood samples, something that in   circumstances could mean a person has to return to the pharmacy to get tested again. Theranos reported no data for 2. 2% of samples, compared to 0. 2% for LabCorp and 0% for Quest. Technicians  when drawing a drop of blood with a finger prick and there wouldn’t be enough backup material to rerun a test, though we don’t know if that is the responsible factor here.” ’Young says that methodological issues could explain why Theranos found more ”abnormal” results and why they rejected more blood samples. He says that each lab may calculate what’’s normal in their own way, and so  —   depending on the test  —   a number that looks ”out of range” to one lab might be normal to another.’ ’”Each laboratory essentially establishes or verifies their own reference range,” since depending on what specifically is being tested and the way it’’s being analyzed, a different result may be expected, according to Young.’ ”Strange as that may sound, that’s not unusual, according to independent experts.” ’’ ’”That is true for many [tests],” says Dr. David Koch, former president and current board member of the American Association for Clinical Chemistry and a professor at Emory University. ”But it’’s not necessarily true for the lipid tests that this study points out as one of the main issues for Theranos. ”’ ’The company performed most differently from the other services with   tests that measure cholesterol. In this study, Theranos consistently reported results about 10% lower than the other two reference labs, something the authors say would exceed federal regulators’’ ”allowable error” margin. This could mean that someone who should be on medication for high cholesterol could get a result that tells them they are OK, which has clinical implications.’ ”Koch says the study does an important thing in pointing out that there’s a certain amount of variation that’s to be expected in many tests. But lipid tests, for cholesterol, are some of the few tests that are measured on a standard that’s generally internationally agreed upon, according to Koch.” ’Young says that the ways the researchers interpreted the results could have made cholesterol results appear more abnormal than they are and that since their test is a unique one, it is going to return slightly different results.’ ”The Theranos team also argues that doing   tests after drawing blood from someone’s arm could have made it more likely that samples would be rejected.” ’”I don’’t buy that,” says Koch.’ ’Others agree. ”I can’’t see how that would make a difference,” says Alan Wu, chief of the clinical chemistry and toxicology laboratories at San Francisco General Hospital. Still, Theranos says its internal data shows lower rejection rates.’ ’A few differences aside,   results between the companies were fairly comparable. For 15 of the 22 tests, there was significant variation in the results between LabCorp, Quest, and Theranos. LabCorp consistently returned lower values for    count, while Theranos consistently reported higher counts of certain white blood cells. For the most part, these variations fit into the normal, allowable range.’ ”And as Young points out, this study just compares what Theranos found to what Quest and LabCorp found. We don’t actually know what result was the most accurate.” ’Schadt says that, problems aside, the results show that Theranos is at least ”on the right path,” and that perhaps if the company had been more open with its data in the first place it may have been able to fix some of its issues already.’ ’’ ”We still don’t have a complete, easy answer to the original question: Do Theranos’ tests work?” ”Since the Mount Sinai team didn’t coordinate with Theranos, they didn’t know for sure that all the Theranos tests were actually run on proprietary Theranos technology, which raised some questions about the best way to interpret results.” ’Theranos representatives have confirmed to Tech Insider that these tests were all run on Theranos technology.’ ”Schadt says they had reached out to Theranos since the study to confirm details of the study, but says that the company was not responsive. In a letter that Theranos sent to the Journal of Clinical Investigation that Tech Insider has reviewed, Theranos disputes that and says that it’s confirmed that no Theranos executive received an email from Schadt.” ”Tech Insider has seen screenshots of LinkedIn messages that Schadt sent to Theranos COO and President Sunny Balwani and to Patrick O’Neill, chief creative officer of Theranos, though we haven’t been able to confirm whether or not those messages arrived in the email inboxes of those executives.” ’’ ”Still, even if these results tell us that some of Theranos’ tests work  —   or don’t  —   that’s perhaps even a bigger reason to study the rest of its tests.” ”The Mount Sinai team ran 22 different tests, but Theranos offers more than 100. They didn’t run the tests for vitamin D, prostate cancer, and thyroid hormones that were  in The Wall Street Journal report that cited former Theranos employees, and so it’s possible that the company still has problems with those tests  —   and potentially with many others. Or they could be within a normal range.” ”Outside experts say they think these results don’t look great for Theranos.” ”Wu says that it’s perfectly possible that some Theranos tests work much better than others, but if that’s the case, then a doctor who needs to get a number of tests done won’t want to send a patient to a Theranos center just for certain tests.” ’ a professor of laboratory medicine and pathobiology at the University of Toronto who  points out that the study is just a snapshot of Theranos performance at one point in time, and that you’’d want to see how effective its tests are over months or years if you could. But for now, he says, ”this paper outlines that low volume blood collection via finger prick (Theranos nanotainer) is not as good as standard venipuncture” . .. for now, at least.’ ’”This article at least is pointing out that there are some systematic biases and this is rather striking,” says Koch.’ ’Still, Schadt says that ”at the end of the day, you just want to know: How much confidence can I have in that result?” He doesn’’t think the results necessarily look bad for Theranos.’ ’He’’s not negative on what Theranos is trying to do and says that allowing people to get more health data and trying new ways of doing things is a good thing. But he wonders why it’’s taken so long to figure out whether or not they work: ”The biggest surprise to me is, why did nobody else do this? ”’ ’Asked about their biggest error, Schadt says it’’s ”the thought that you don’’t have to engage the medical community . .. to help calibrate and validate. ”’ ”Elizabeth Holmes has said Theranos considers the US Food and Drug Administration the ultimate arbiter of accuracy, but Schadt says that that isn’t enough.” ’He says:’ ’Medical researchers have finally gone and run. ..’"
362,"Fake News: No, the Pope Hasn’t ‘Softened’ Teaching on Abortion",2016-11-22,"Pope Francis has granted all priests of the Catholic Church the faculty of absolving the sin of abortion, which several media outlets immediately misinterpreted as a “relaxing” of the Church’s stance on abortion. [The Independent, for example, stated that the measure “represents a significant softening of the church’s stance on the issue of abortion,” while a headline in the Italian daily Il Messaggero trumpeted that the Pope had “broken the taboo” of abortion. For its part, CNN declared that the Pope had said that “abortion is forgivable. ”  In another piece, CNN floated the still more ridiculous hypothesis that the Pope’s letter “could be read as the pontiff reflecting on some Catholics’ decision to vote for Donald Trump. ” In point of fact, the Pope went out of his way to avoid just this sort of misreading of his intentions. “I wish to restate as firmly as I can that abortion is a grave sin, since it puts an end to an innocent life,” he wrote in the new letter Misericordia et Misera. “In the same way, however, I can and must state that there is no sin that God’s mercy cannot reach and wipe away when it finds a repentant heart seeking to be reconciled with the Father. ” Earlier this week, Francis used particularly blunt language to describe the evil of abortion, calling it both a “horrendous crime” and a “very grave sin. ” In his Christmas message two years ago, the Pope compared the slaughter of millions of babies by abortion to the massacre of the innocents at the hand of King Herod, who sought to eliminate the newborn baby Jesus 2, 000 years ago. So, while Pope Francis has reiterated the iniquity of taking the life of an innocent unborn child, he has also wished to make it clear that there is no sin so great that God cannot forgive it. He has also sought to remove obstacles that might prevent people from seeking God’s mercy when they realize what they have done. Since Catholics consider abortion a particularly grave sin, those who engage in it incur the penalty of automatic excommunication, and so the Church only allowed bishops and designated priests to absolve it. In actual practice, bishops routinely extended this permission to any priest of the diocese who asked for it. A year ago, Pope Francis granted all priests the faculty of absolving the sin of abortion and lifting the excommunication attached to it for the duration of the Jubilee Year of Mercy. Now, he has made that measure permanent. The real news here is interesting enough without twisting it into something else. For some, apparently, the temptation is too strong to resist.

For example, Fox News writes: The Southern Poverty Law Center described TWP as a group formed in 2015 as the political wing of the Traditionalist Youth Network, which aims to “indoctrinate high school and college students into white nationalism. ” It is worth noting that the SPLC does not seem to acknowledge the rising danger of the “ ” or “  movement,” which makes no distinction between fringe groups like the Traditionalist Workers Party and ordinary people who attend Donald Trump events. As Breitbart’s Adelle Nazarian points out: “The   and Anarchists are one and the same now, and they also have the same colors, i. e. red and black. Under this same   or anarchist umbrella there are also anarchists that claim to not adhere to violence. The Black Bloc are part of this group, but they are actually the violent anarchists.

Some of these attacks follow hyperbolic allegations by some on the left (and even some on the right, such as Glenn Beck) that Donald Trump is “Hitler. ”   groups were also behind the attack on journalist Lauren Southern from the Canadian news site The Rebel: Although the fringe Traditionalist Workers Party group claims to be against leftism, its political agenda shares many similarities with the far left, including its avowed support for socialism and its hostility to Israel and “Zionists. ” In a video broadcast discussing the attack, the TWP also favored the same racial separatist agenda as   groups. As previously reported by Breitbart News, groups like the Freedom Road Socialist Organization believe that Chicano and black people should have their own separate countries. Similarly, commentators on the   extremist Red Ice TV show have suggested that racial groups have their own land area. Similar views are shared by some members of   groups such as Black Lives Matter.

365,Guardian: Israeli Self-defense Measures Are ’Deadly Retaliations’,2016-03-07,"TEL AVIV  —   The Guardian ran a story Thursday in which it called Israeli   against Palestinian terror attacks “deadly retaliations. ”[The article, which focused on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s call to deport the families of terrorists to Gaza, opened with the following paragraph:  Binyamin Netanyahu has threatened to expel families of Palestinian attackers to Gaza after a   wave of violence against Israeli citizens and targets that has met with deadly retaliation from security forces. Media watchdog HonestReporting. com noted that the story was authored by Guardian “staff and agencies,” and no other press agency, including the Associated Press, Reuters, and AFP, used that terminology, leading the watchdog to conclude that it was the Guardian’s decision to refer to “deadly retaliation” by Israeli security forces. HonestReporting’s Simon Plosker includes a dictionary definition of retaliate as “do[ing] something bad to someone who has hurt you or treated you badly: to get revenge against someone. ” Plosker writes: Israel is not taking revenge against Palestinians, which implies some level of malevolent intent or malice. And Israeli security forces taking actions to defending Israeli citizens or themselves from Palestinian terrorists or rioters is not inherently “bad,” it is legitimate  . Language is important. While Palestinian actions are described as a “wave of violence,” Israeli countermeasures are deemed to be “deadly retaliation. ” It is just this type of language that skews the current Palestinian wave of terror, turning Palestinian assailants into victims and Israelis into perpetrators. The Guardian has been accused of publishing articles that show an   bias. On more than one occasion, the UK newspaper was accused of publishing misleading headlines inverting Palestinian terrorism and its victims. Two weeks ago, Breitbart reported that the Guardian‘s Readers Editor Chris Elliot said the newspaper was issuing new guidelines designed to “tell as much of the story as possible, especially where Palestinians are killed when attacking people. ” More recently, Breitbart reported on a Guardian column claiming that Jewish collective memory was the root cause of Israel’s “deformed society. ”"
366,"Gun Control Groups Pivot, Look To Bloomberg For White House Win - Breitbart",2016-02-15,"The results of New Hampshire —  resounding wins for Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump —  have some gun control groups pivoting from away from Hillary Clinton and hoping Michael Bloomberg will step in to win the day for their side. [Gun control groups —  Connecticut Against Gun Violence (CAGV) Newtown Action Alliance, and others —  want to be sure a candidate who supports gun control wins the White House, and Clinton’s current performance does not inspire their confidence.  According to CT Post, “Clinton’s stumble” has the potential of shifting political alliances. CAGV executive director Ron Pinciaro said, “Of course, Bloomberg has been very helpful on our issue, and we would see (his possible candidacy) as a good thing. ” But Senator Richard Blumenthal ( ) —  a staunch Clinton supporter —  urged the gun control groups not to switch to their loyalties too quick. Blumenthal said: I have deep admiration for Michael Bloomberg’s eloquent advocacy on this issue, but I think Hillary Clinton has demonstrated over many years her equal passion and fervor. My hope is that no candidate owns this issue and that they are all on the right side with the same passion and commitment, and that it becomes a defining issue between the Democrat and Republican candidates, not among the candidates on our side. Yet gun control groups are already choosing between candidates on the Democrat side. Newtown Action Alliance chairwoman Po Murray had already made clear that her group believes Hillary will “go    with the NRA,” but they don’t trust Sanders to do the same.

367,It’s Thrilling. It’s Chilling. It’s a 30-Minute Commercial. - The New York Times,2016-08-22,"“Lifeline” is a   thriller directed by an Academy Award winner about a man’s search for his missing girlfriend. In the film, set in Shanghai with a plot driven by corporate malfeasance, punches are thrown, shots are fired and people are killed. At one point, the actress Olivia Munn stands over a dead woman, blood on her hands. But this is no ordinary movie. It is an online advertisement for the mobile technology company Qualcomm and, in particular, its Snapdragon 820 chip set, a smartphone processor. As more people skip or block ads when streaming shows or browsing websites, advertisers are trying to find new ways to deliver their messages. The internet has long been a place where companies have tried to break out of the   and   ad model, but as it has become easier to present   videos online  —   and as top directors and actors have shown a willingness to be involved  —   these efforts have become more sophisticated. The goal of “Lifeline” and similar ads is “to make something you want to see  —   and the holy grail is if people seek you out,” said Teddy Lynn, chief creative officer for content and social at Ogilvy  Mather, which produced the film. “This is a piece of entertainment that can compete in a very crowded marketplace. ” “Lifeline” was released in May and pushed out on multiple social media channels in the United States and China. “Inside Lifeline,” a      look at the film, is also available on the “Lifeline” website. It emphasizes the importance of the cellphone to the action in the film and the phone’s various features the film hopes to highlight, like its long battery life and improved photo capability. In many ways, “Lifeline” is just an extension of product placement and show sponsorship by advertisers that goes back to the early days of radio and television, said Lou Aversano, chief executive of Ogilvy  Mather NY. “I think we continue to push, not just in terms of length, but in terms of the line between entertainment and brand message,” he said. Many companies are looking for ways to promote their brand through longer storytelling, such as Johnnie Walker, Nike and Prada. It is an impulse that dates to at least 2001 or 2002, when a series of eight   films for BMW starring Clive Owen appeared online. “That was at the time the internet was still ” said Steve Golin, founder and chief executive of Anonymous Content, a multimedia development company that produced the BMW ads and “Lifeline. ” “It would take all night to download. ” “Lifeline,” which stars Ms. Munn, Leehom Wang and Joan Chen, is directed by Armando Bo, who won an Oscar for best original screenplay for “Birdman” in 2015. The film has attracted 20 million views. There have been an additional 100 million combined views of the film’s trailers and the    video, Mr. Lynn said. Eighty percent of the views came from China, which was the primary market. The dialogue is 70 percent in Chinese and 30 percent in English. Mr. Lynn said Qualcomm would not disclose the cost of the ad, but noted that with less money needed to buy time on television, more was available for the production. “You can create content that is compelling and you don’t have to spend money to place it on TV,” said Mr. Golin, whose company has been involved with movies like “Spotlight” and “The Revenant” and TV shows like “Mr. Robot. ” “We think this is the direction advertising is headed. As long as sports exists, we will still do   and   commercials, but with most other entertainment there is a lot of resistance to watching    advertising. ” Mark Crispin Miller, a professor of media studies at New York University, said the disappearing boundaries between advertising and entertainment could be troubling. Ads, by their nature, often exaggerate “the benefits or virtues of the products and, even more troubling, downplay the dangers or risk of a product,” Mr. Miller said. And using big stars “makes the commercial intent even harder to perceive and blurs the true purpose behind the work. ” Still, more advertisers are eager to experiment. Take “The Ballad of the Dreadnought,” a   documentary about the distinctive guitar body originally manufactured by C. F. Martin  Company. It is narrated by Jeff Daniels and includes interviews with musicians like Rosanne Cash, Stephen Stills and Steve Miller. The film appears solely on Martin’s website, but was selected to appear at several film festivals. It has received 40, 000 views since it first streamed on May 5, said Scott Byers, a managing partner at Lehigh Mining  Navigation, the advertising agency that developed the film. The documentary idea developed, Mr. Byers said, when Martin came to his agency wanting to celebrate the dreadnought guitar, which was developed in the early 20th century but never trademarked, enabling many other manufacturers to copy it over the years. “They asked, ‘What can we do to reclaim ownership of the shape? ’” said Denis Aumiller, also a managing partner at the agency. “The initial thought was that we would produce a short,   product video, or maybe a magazine article. ” As enticing as it may be to think of every commercial as a potential short film that could play on the festival circuit, creating something that attracts viewers and promotes a product is not easy. Entertainment, after all, is not the ultimate goal. “At some point,” Mr. Aversano said, “there’s a responsibility to deliver the message of the brand. Otherwise it’s just empty calories. ”"

369,Cheap Gas Prices are Trickle-Down Tax Cut of $1500 - Breitbart,2016-02-29,"Liberals should find a new respect for tax cuts, because cheaper gasoline prices are acting like a $1, 500 “ ” tax cut for every American household, goosing revenue at local restaurants, groceries, charities and retail stories. [The United States has gone through the most epic increase in government spending over the last seven years as the Obama administration conducted an experiment in “ ” economics, in which an increase in consumer demand would be stimulated through government spending, funded by higher taxes on the wealthy.  To pay for his “ ” spending, President Obama and the   Democrat Congress in December 2010 passed Obamacare, the biggest tax increase in U. S. history. According to the Obama Administration “static” economic models at the time, increases and decreases in federal tax rates would have no impact on economic economy. But that seems clearly wrong, given that the U. S. economy is recovering at the worst rate of growth from a recession in seven decades, and the national debt has almost doubled to $19. 1 trillion. This grim story gets worse when adding to the debt the “stated” underfunding of federal employee and military pensions retiree healthcare the underfunding of Social Security the underfunding of Medicare and the commitments and contingencies guarantees the federal government has made. The net national debt is $65 trillion, according to David Walker, former head of the   Government Accountability Office from 1998 to 2008. Despite average savings per American family of just $9, 149, the average family’s share of the $65 trillion federal debt is $796, 589, according to the U. S. Debt Clock. To pay off their share of all federal debts as if it were a   mortgage at a 4. 5 percent interest rate, each American family would need to make a $4, 036. 19 payment every month. Liberals have tried wordsmithing away the obvious benefits of President Ronald Reagan’s lower tax rates that stimulate economic activity to generate higher labor demand and wages by calling them “  economics. ” But as Breitbart News reported, a 2012 study from Christina Romer, the Obama Administration’s first head of the Council of Economic Advisers, stated: “Tax increases appear to have a very large, sustained, and highly significant negative impact on output   …     [and] tax cuts have very large and persistent positive output effects. ” Luckily, the private sector has partly offset Obamas policies. The American energy boom doubled U. S. oil production, cut gasoline prices, and created a quasi   worth about $1, 500 a year for each average American household. That private sector triumph is stimulating the economy by allowing Americans to redirect roughly 80 percent of the gasoline price savings to spending on other household priorities. Breitbart News calculates that for every penny decline in gasoline prices, American consumers are saving about $1 billion in energy costs. With average gasoline prices plunging from about $3. 34 a gallon in 2013 to $1. 77 a gallon on Feb 28, according to AAA, consumers are saving about $157 billion in annual gasoline spending. Adjusting the 1986 Reagan tax cuts of $68. 7 billion for 216 percent inflation equals about $148. 7 billion today, fairly similar to the impact of the current crash in gasoline prices. The JP Morgan Chase Institute estimates that from its huge national customer base of 57 million American credit and debit card holders, consumers will spend about 81 percent of their gasoline expenditures and save about 19 percent. JP Morgan Chase warned that it will take time for households to become confident that savings from lower gasoline prices are here to stay. But the bank suggests the breakdown in   spending from lower gasoline prices will be: 18 percent at restaurants, 23 percent on services, 33 percent on   10 percent on groceries, 6 percent on durable goods, 2 percent charitable donations and 8 percent “other. ”"
370,Freedom Caucus’ Jordan: Tweets and blame ’don’t change facts’,2017-04-02,"Washington (CNN) One of President Donald Trump’s top targets didn’t budge Sunday from his opposition to the failed Republican health care bill in the face of multiple critical tweets from President Donald Trump since the defeat of the proposal, saying the legislation was both bad policy and massively unpopular. ”Tweets and statements and blame don’t change facts,” Republican Rep. Jim Jordan, an Ohio member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, told Jake Tapper on CNN’s ”State of the Union.”  Citing a recent Quinnipiac University poll, Jordan asked incredulously, ”When have you seen a bill come forward where only 17% of the country supports it?” Trump took to Twitter on Thursday to call out Jordan, the former chairman of the conservative House group, as well as its current leader, Mark Meadows of North Carolina and fellow member Raul Labrador of Idaho over their opposition to the   GOP plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama’s signature health care program.  On Saturday, the White House’s social media director, Dan Scavino, also went after another Freedom Caucus member, Michigan Rep. Justin Amash, saying Trump’s supporters should drive him out of office in the next primary election. Amash responded shortly afterward by tweeting that Trump had become like the very political establishment that he campaigned against and the caucus has opposed. Jordan defended Amash on Sunday and said he would come to his aid in a primary challenge. ”Justin Amash is a good friend and one of the most principled members of Congress,” Jordan said. ”And, frankly, if he is primaried, I’m going to do everything I can to help him. Richard Painter, a White House ethics lawyer under former President George W. Bush, tweeted that Scavino’s call to action violated the Hatch Act by using his government position to influence an election, saying the Bush administration would have fired him for such behavior. Scavino responded Sunday afternoon to comments from ethics lawyers, such as Painter, on the issue by tweeting from his personal Twitter account, ”What ’ethics lawyers?’ The ones from the Obama Admin who want to take Trump down, or the Bush Admin who were #NeverTrump? No thanks!” He also made a tweak to his Twitter bio, removing the reference to his current White House position and substituting in his role as social media director for Trump’s campaign. Questioning process, Asked Sunday about the primary threats that those who opposed the GOP health care proposal, including himself, could face, Jordan said, ”If that’s what happens, that’s what happens.” Republicans needed to get back together on a health care bill that repealed Obamacare, he said, adding that the process needed to be more open next time and include input from interest groups and average citizens. ”Why not actually have doctors come in and testify, maybe hospitals testify, or maybe just some regular American families who this bill’s gonna impact,” Jordan said. ”Why not have that kind of process take place?” On Sunday, just a day after Scavino’s call to take down Amash, Trump tweeted that those who think the GOP health care proposal is dead don’t know the ”love and strength” of the Republican Party and said talks to repeal and replace Obamacare will continue. The tweets came as something of a public shift for Trump. After House Speaker Paul Ryan pulled the bill in March amid opposition from conservative and moderate corners of the Republican Party, the Wisconsin Republican said Obamacare would remain the law of the land for the foreseeable future, and Trump said he would move on, likely to tax reform, until Obamacare ”explodes.”  Trump spent part of his Sunday playing a game of golf and talking health care with Sen. Rand Paul, according to a White House spokeswoman. The Kentucky Republican was among the most vocal opponents of the   health care bill."
371,Propaganda film project backfires on North Korea ,2016-06-22," (CNN) A documentary intended as a portrayal of a happy family in North Korea has instead become a    look at how the country’s authorities manipulate appearances. The film ”Under the Sun,” which airs at a film festival in Washington on Thursday, assembles smuggled outtakes to show the inner workings of how a propaganda film is made in North Korea, a country known for fiercely controlling its image.  With a script agreed upon by North Korean officials and Russian documentary filmmaker Vitaly Mansky, the project began as a portrait of a supposedly ordinary    girl in Pyongyang named Ri Zin Mi, as she prepares to join the upcoming pageantry for the birthday of Kim Jong Il, the late North Korean leader. They also worked out access to the girl, her family, her home, her school, and even the workplaces of her parents. It is unclear whether the film crew and the North Koreans ever had the same vision for how the film should turn out. But soon after filming began, the filmmakers began to chafe at the expectations of the North Korean authorities. ”It was completely fake,” said producer Simone Baumann. ”They would come to the scene, and would tell the people what they have to do, where they have to sit, how they have to sit, how they have to smile, they would tell them what they have to say.” ’Say that joyfully’ In scene after scene, the movie reveals the outtakes of North Korean handlers staging each scene for the cameras, instructing everyone on what to do, feeding them lines, and directing them to show more enthusiasm. In one setup, an official tells factory workers to be more effusive about their work. ”One more time. Why is your applause so weak?” he says. At a second factory, the handler feeds the workers lines about productivity and workplace satisfaction. ”Say that joyfully,” he adds. Even a highly decorated war veteran is not immune: a minder interrupts him and tells him to finish up his war stories, and segue to his scripted lines. And for a scene where the young Zin Mi is tucked into bed, two handlers are seen arranging the shot, right down to the blankets. As disputes worsened over the direction of the project, North Korean authorities announced they were pulling the plug. But the filmmakers still had the footage, including the outtakes, thanks to a camera that was always rolling, and a recording system that used two memory cards instead of one. Baumann said North Korean censors would review the footage every night and delete clips they did not approve of. But the camera crew, risking unknown consequences if they were caught, kept a duplicate memory card of each shoot.  ”The camerawoman is very brave. She put [the memory card] in her trousers when she went to the toilet,” said Baumann. ”They gave one of them to the North Koreans, and the second one they took with them.” Using the smuggled footage, the filmmakers decided to continue the project, unauthorized, as a    exposé. ”We decided we had to show that everything is staged,” said Baumann. A sardonic explanation is shown onscreen near the beginning of the movie: ”The script of this film was assigned to us by the North Korean side. They also kindly provided us with a    escort service, chose our filming locations, and looked over all the footage we shot, to make sure we did not make any mistakes in showing the life of a perfectly ordinary family in the best country in the world.” Parents call director a hypocrite, The movie, with its arresting cinematography and deliberate pacing, includes rarely seen glimpses of daily life in the supposed workers’ paradise: shuffling workers being harangued with loudspeaker slogans colorless streets almost devoid of cars and the dreary sight of piles of flowers carted away from a memorial where children had dutifully placed them. ”This film confirms the reality that everything is ” said Robert Boynton of New York University, author of a book about North Korea called The   Zone. ”That whatever we see is what they want us to see, that people’s lines are fed to them, that everything is choreographed.” But the girl’s parents have been quoted denouncing the film, saying it was made under false pretenses and was selectively edited to make an ”  Korean movie.” According to a story on the North Korean news site Arirang Meari, they call the director a hypocrite, saying it was the director himself who often insisted on staging their daughter’s scenes. ”Vitaly Mansky directed her, told her, ’Do this, do that,’ ” her mother is quoted as saying. ”We thought he was making the documentary for the purpose of a friendly cultural exchange,” she added. ”We did not know Mansky was such a   person.”  The government of North Korea intensely protects its image, both at home and abroad. Indeed, shortly before Sony Pictures was to release ”The Interview,” a movie depicting the assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, North Korean hackers launched a devastating   on the company’s infrastructure, according to American officials. The movie has been shown at film festivals, Citing fears of similar retaliatory   one American film festival curator even backed out of showing ”Under the Sun,” at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. The museum has now disavowed that decision, according to museum spokeswoman Margaret Doyle, and the curator is no longer employed there. But in spite of North Korean officials writing to Russian officials demanding the film be blocked, the movie has been shown at film festivals in Russia, South Korea, and elsewhere, including the AFI Docs festival beginning Thursday in Washington. It is also scheduled for a limited run in U. S. theaters, starting July 6 at the Film Forum in New York Cityand July 15 at Laemmle Monica Film Center in Los Angeles. Boynton expects the North Korean family in the movie to suffer no blowback from the way the film turned out. But he added, ”I think the biggest fallout would be probably for, certainly the people who negotiated and allowed Mansky to enter the country, and secondly to the minders who guided his crew. They might be in trouble.”"

373,BuzzFeed Still Hounding Christian ’Fixer Upper’ Hosts,2016-12-02,"BuzzFeed has not let up on Christian TV stars Chip and Joanna Gaines, with reporter Kate Aurthur implicitly warning the hosts of HGTV’s Fixer Upper that they will receive more bad press unless the show features a   couple. [On Thursday, the site posted a statement from HGTV affirming the network’s policy of LGBT inclusion the network was responding to a Tuesday article from Aurthur implying that the Christian hosts might discriminate against gay couples.  “We don’t discriminate against members of the LGBT community in any of our shows,” the network said in a statement. “HGTV is proud to have a crystal clear, consistent record of including people from all walks of life in its series. ” That wasn’t enough for Aurthur, who made a point of noting that Fixer Upper has not yet included a gay couple in each of its first three seasons: “When pressed about   couples being welcome on Fixer Upper in particular, the representative for HGTV highlighted the phrase “in any of our shows. ” The series, which just launched its fourth season, has yet to do so. ” Aurthur appears to insinuate that HGTV is   even after acknowledging in her previous article that two other popular programs on the network, Property Brothers and House Hunters, have featured gay couples in the past. The absence of gay couples on Fixer Upper is apparently enough evidence for BuzzFeed to suggest that the show, the couple and the network are all   bigots. Aurthur’s second story on the Gaineses also claims that the first article “sparked a firestorm of criticism from Christians who argued that people who oppose   marriage and LGBT rights are persecuted by the media. ” But most of the criticism of the first article came not just from Christians, but also from BuzzFeed’s own readers and from many of Aurthur’s peers in the media. As one BuzzFeed reader wrote in response to the first article: “This is a tired, forced witch hunt. You are inciting a wave of negative attention on this couple for something that indirectly links to them. That’s not journalism, it’s petty bullsh*t. ” BuzzFeed editor Ben Smith’s weak response to the original article on his Twitter account was similarly challenged by journalists from the Daily Beast and Business Insider. Aurthur’s original story reported that Chip and Joanna Gaines attend a church in their hometown of Waco, Texas whose founder, pastor Jimmy Seibert, believes in traditional marriage. In response to the story, Pastor Seibert told Fox News’ Todd Starnes that his Antioch Community Church is “absolutely not”  . “We are not only not   but we are   people in their journey to find out who God is and who He has made them to be,” he said. “For us  —   our heart has always been to love Jesus, preach the word of God and help people in their journey. ”   Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum"
374,"Islamic Kindergarten Used For Orgies, Drugs",2016-03-18,"Sex orgies, drug use and other questionable activities are alleged to have taken place at an Islamic kindergarten in Vienna. [The allegations surround a network of Islamic kindergartens run by a man known only as “Abdullah P” who is currently under investigation on suspected charges of fraud.  One of the kindergartens, which are all subsidised by the Austrian tax payer, is said to have housed sex parties and has also been used as a front for selling and manufacturing drugs, as reported by Austrian paper Kronen Zeitung. The kindergarten, located in the Brigittenau suburb of Vienna, is considered the operational “headquarters” of Abdullah P. Information was handed to the police by witnesses of the sex parties and drug use.   Abdullah, who claims to be a “businessman” has been at the centre of controversy before over the   education and integration centres he has ran in the past. Several other Islamic kindergartens he currently runs have also been linked to the teaching of radical Islamist beliefs. The elementary school in Vienna was shut down last year by authorities who said it posed an “imminent danger. ” It is unclear if these are the same schools that employed a Muslim woman who tried to join the Islamic State. The rise in links to radical Islam in Austrian kindergartens had led at least one Austrian academic to say that parallel societies are starting to emerge. The 26   witness who blew the whistle on the sex parties and drugs told prosecutors he learned about them via an online dating site. He said he became friends with one of Abdullah’s colleagues who told him about the wild   parties. The colleague told the witness that he regularly celebrated with Abdullah by having sex parties at the kindergarten on Romano alley, and that they also consumed large quantities of various drugs. The witness also gave names and descriptions of other participants and told how a cleaning lady accidentally discovered “white powder” in a drawer at the facility where children were daily. The facility may also play a role in the drug scene in the area according to police. Police say that a huge cache of 970 marijuana plants, discovered in a Vienna warehouse in January, may have been grown in an adjacent building to the Romano alley kindergarten. Abdullah took over the building shortly after the last tenant went bankrupt in December 2015. Abdullah had told authorities he acquired the building in order to create an Islamic school. The Muslim network of integration centres and faith schools, which Abdullah is the head of, are funded by Viennese tax payers to the tune of five million euros. The initial case against Abdullah revolves around his application for government money by creating false charities and forging documents in order to secure more cash from the taxpayer. Bogus registrations and false invoices led to him lining his own pockets with money that was meant to train kindergarten teachers and care for children. The total loss to the city is projected to amount to millions of euros. Abdullah’s organization collected at least 1. 8 million euros over two years to May 2015."
375,"Dylan, Polite? It Ain’t Him, Babe - The New York Times",2017-04-11,"STOCKHOLM  —   “I’m Not There” was the title of a 2007 movie about the exquisite elusiveness of the singer Bob Dylan. It is also the unofficial theme of the week in Stockholm, where Mr. Dylan, who won the 2016 Nobel Prize in Literature, is not here to accept it. He has not been here for anything else, either. He did not attend the traditional news conference. He did not deliver the traditional lecture. He did not make the traditional visit to a local school, or take part in the traditional fancy dinner with the Swedish Academy, which awards the literature Nobel every year. (All those events were canceled.) And as he said before, he will not be at the ceremony on Saturday, when the literature prize is to be awarded along with the medicine, economics and science prizes, or at the banquet afterward. Though Mr. Dylan has sent a message of thanks to be read aloud, he has not dispatched someone to accept the award on his behalf, as other   have done. “From a P. R. viewpoint, it’s been a disaster,” said Jens Liljestrand, the book editor at the Swedish newspaper Expressen. “It’s been a very unfortunate autumn for the Swedish Academy. ” Mr. Dylan’s absence seems of a piece with his legendarily perverse unpredictability. But it has also saddled the highly secretive academy, which is nearly as inscrutable as Mr. Dylan, with the difficult task of explaining to the world why it does not feel insulted. As the debate rages in Sweden  —   is Mr. Dylan’s behavior simple rudeness? a fear of being thrust into the Nobel spotlight? some sort of elaborate piece of performance art?  —   the academy has taken the position, at least publicly, that none of it matters. “I completely respect his decision, and I assume that he has very good reasons for not coming,” Sara Danius, the academy’s permanent secretary, said in an interview. “He may be completely booked, or he may have personal reasons. ” But in a Nobelcentric place where the literature prize is such big news that people gather around their television sets every October to hear the announcement, Mr. Dylan’s absence has been seen as faintly embarrassing at best. “Having a Nobel Prize without a Nobel Prize winner is not much fun,” said the writer and former publisher Per Gedin. Some Swedes have spoken wistfully about what he is missing. “It’s a really warm and welcoming program arranged to make the winner happy,” said the publisher Dorotea Bromberg, who recalled shepherding J. M. Coetzee, the South African writer, around Stockholm when he won the literature prize in 2003. Initially, Mr. Coetzee was reluctant, she said, but “day by day he warmed up” and actually ended up enjoying himself. Mr. Dylan is not the only winner in recent years who has failed to appear. Others include Alice Munro, Doris Lessing, Harold Pinter and Elfriede Jelinek, but their reasons had to do with illness, old age and, in the case of Ms. Jelinek, various prohibitive phobias (crowds, flying). In each case, the winner either delivered a lecture that was filmed and transmitted to Stockholm or had the lecture read aloud. Mr. Dylan’s absence, however, does seem consistent with his general approach. “He’s behaved so strangely for so many years that if he would show up now and be cheerful and pleased, you’d be surprised,” said Daniel Sandstrom, the literary director at the publisher Albert Bonniers. Also, he said, Mr. Dylan’s politeness (or not) should have no bearing on whether he deserves to win the prize. “It would be very bad to award it just to nice people,” he said. Worse, in the view of some, is that Mr. Dylan’s win may disqualify other Americans, like Don DeLillo and Philip Roth, from winning, at least in the near future. Mr. Dylan is the first American laureate to win since Toni Morrison did so in 1993. “It’s very unkind, to put it mildly, to give it to an American but to give it to the wrong American,” said Mr. Gedin, who believes the prize should have gone to a more traditional writer. The academy is accustomed to unconventional behavior from Nobel laureates, who do not always exhibit unalloyed joy when they get the notifying telephone call. Some are scared some seem almost irritated some instruct their spouses to say they cannot come to the phone some affect an air of insouciant indifference. With the Belarussian journalist Svetlana Alexievich, who won last year, there was a language issue. “I tried French I tried German,” Ms. Danius said. “She didn’t understand what I was saying, although she did understand ‘Nobel’ and ‘prize. ’” But Mr. Dylan’s behavior has been at the extreme end of the spectrum, starting from a failure, for nearly two weeks, to respond to Ms. Danius’s phone and email messages. “Strange things have happened before, but nothing on this level,” said Per Wastberg, the chairman of the Nobel Committee at the academy. Ms. Danius’s assertion that Mr. Dylan’s behavior is not a concern  —   “The important thing is that the Nobel Prize in Literature belongs to Bob Dylan,” she said  —   is testament to the academy’s view of itself as impervious to outside criticism and pressure. Highly secretive about its inner workings, it exists as something of a paradox: both steeped in the world literary community and strangely apart from and above it. Founded to promote Swedish language and literature by King Gustaf III in 1786, the academy took on the Nobel literature responsibilities in 1901, the first year the prize was awarded (the winner was the French author Sully Prudhomme). Its 18 members, who serve until they die (they can stop attending meetings, but they cannot resign) are an idiosyncratic collection of writers, academics and specialists in  —   and advocates for  —   particular areas of literature. Each year, the academy invites academic institutions, scholars, literary organizations, former laureates and others to put forth nominees. You are not meant to nominate yourself, though it happens all the time. “We get at least one letter a week from someone who says, ‘I’m fantastic  —   you should read my book,’” Ms. Danius said. (These applicants are automatically disqualified.) Winners must have previously made the   shortlist at least once, and it seems that Mr. Dylan’s name had been kicking around for a while. The prize is meant to reward a life’s body of work, notwithstanding that even great writers produce material that not everyone loves. “Doris Lessing was on the shortlist for quite a while before my time, and then she wrote a series of   novels that sank her in the view of the academy,” Mr. Wastberg said. However, her name was resurrected  —   in part because of her   autobiography  —   and she won the prize in 2007. And what of Mr. Dylan’s Nobel lecture, which under the terms of the prize is required to be given within six months of the ceremony? Rumor has it that he’ll be in Stockholm next spring, “though the details are still unclear,” Ms. Danius said, and he has said nothing about giving a speech. “I’m not sure a regular concert will do it,” she added. “But the Swedish Academy always tries to accommodate the laureate’s wishes, so if that’s what he’d like to propose, I’m certain there is a way. ”"
376,Roger Stone: Cruz Doesn’t Have ‘Temperament to Be President’ - Breitbart,2016-04-20,"Veteran political operative Roger Stone questions whether Texas Sen. Ted Cruz has the “temperament” to be president. On Breitbart News Daily on SiriusXM, Stone cited Cruz’s testy interview with radio host Sean Hannity. [“The pressure really is on Cruz now. It’s a very, very narrow path going forward,” Stone said. “I really wonder if Ted Cruz demonstrated he had the temperament to be president last night with Sean Hannity. I don’t want my president blowing up like that. I don’t want the guy with his finger on the button snapping like that. ”  Stone also called GOP frontrunner Donald Trump’s big win in New York a “massacre” and said Cruz should give up on Northeastern states while building support in California. “Given the fact that Connecticut, the most Republican part of Connecticut, is in the New York media market, and that is also true of the upcoming New Jersey  —   the largest part of New Jersey, about 70 percent of New Jersey voters are in the New York media market. This is a win that has an impact on several of the bordering states. So it does magnify the win. This was a massacre,” said Stone. “Trump spent very little resources,” Stone said. “This was once again Donald Trump himself campaigning across the upstate area an in places like Watertown on a very strategically clever operation and targeted congressional districts based on sophisticated polling. So we saw a new sophistication in the Trump campaign we haven’t seen previously and I attribute this to a couple things. ” Stone credited’s Paul Manafort’s role in the campaign and a “  local operation” for delivering New York to Trump. “It was a big, big win and it puts Ted Cruz at a real disadvantage going forward on this upcoming contests,” he said. “And that in turn can give them a head of steam going into California. ” He also advised the Cruz campaign to cut its losses in the Northeast and focus on the upcoming California primary. One of the most important factors in the 2016 election, Stone said, was “voters are upset with what they see as a broken system. They equate this with Congress. ” “This is Trump country,” Stone said of Northeastern states. “Delaware of course is    but not insignificant in terms of the count. I spoke to someone on Governor Maryland’s staff yesterday. He tells me it’s Trump country as far as they can see. ” “You’re going to see the same phenomenon in Baltimore of Democrats being unhappy they can’t vote in the Republican primary. They’re going to show up in droves, I predict, and be turned away because they’re not allowed to vote under the state party rules. I think you’re coming into a period here where this is Trump’s backyard. He’s expected to do well. Ted Cruz won Oklahoma and that’s next to Texas. And this in many ways is the same phenomenon,” Stone added. Breitbart News Daily airs from 6 am to 9 am EST weekdays on SiriusXM Patriot 125. LISTEN: "
377,Source: Huma Abedin Has Not Served Anthony Weiner with Divorce Papers,2017-05-31,"Former Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin is not done with disgraced former politician Anthony Weiner yet, sources say. [A source told the New York Post that Abedin has not “served [Weiner] with the divorce papers,” and she has invited him back home to their luxury duplex in New York City’s Union Square, where she recently renewed the lease.  Abedin filed for divorce from Weiner the same day he pleaded guilty to a charge of sending explicit text messages to a    girl. Abedin and Weiner listed their 1, 500 square foot Union Square duplex for $11, 900 a month but recently pulled the listing. A source from the couple’s apartment building told the Post that Weiner, who was sleeping on his mother’s couch, was “supposed to move” Tuesday, “but they just signed for another year. ” The couple’s friend said Weiner takes on most of the caretaking duties for their    son. “Huma is worried about her son,” the friend said. “That’s her priority, and Anthony plays a very strong role in raising him. ” Even though the couple separated in August 2016, Abedin has reportedly been “working hard” to salvage their relationship amid the sexting scandals. Weiner took a plea deal with the Manhattan U. S. Attorney’s Office, where he will register as a sex offender and could face 21 to 27 months in prison. He is due back in court for sentencing on September 8."
378,"Exclusive — Behind Scenes at Presidential Inaugural Committee: Trump Inauguration to Have Less Pomp, Circumstance So He Can Get Right to Work - Breitbart",2016-12-29,"WASHINGTON, D. C.  —     Donald J. Trump’s inauguration will have less official celebration throughout the day and evening so he can focus on getting right to work on behalf of the American people, officials involved in the planning process tell Breitbart News. The inauguration itself will be less focused on the donor class and ritzy Washington insiders as in years past and more focused on the regular working class people across the country for whom Trump has become the champion. [“The inauguration and inaugural is a representation of the   and a representation of the vice ” Boris Epshteyn, the director of communications for the Presidential Inaugural Committee (PIC) told Breitbart News in an exclusive    tour of the PIC’s offices in Washington, D. C. on Thursday.   “What does that mean? It’s all about the people,” Epshteyn said. “It’s not about any one celebrity or any one entertainer or about any of those folks sipping champagne and cocktails somewhere in the Hamptons or in Beverly Hills. It’s about the American people. We’re so proud of the amount of support and outreach we’ve received from all over the country. This inaugural will represent the people. That’s one, and two it’s about getting to work right away. ” So, logistically, what does this all mean? Specifically, Epshteyn says, Trump will only have three official inaugural balls as compared with 10 separate balls for Barack Obama’s 2009 inauguration. “There will three balls instead of 10, as there were in 2009 with President Obama because this president —  Donald J. Trump —  is all about getting to work and making sure Americans are safe in their homes, safe in their jobs,” Epshteyn said. “Look at the news that just came out this week: 8, 000 jobs being brought to America between Sprint and OneWeb. ” Alex Stroman, the deputy director of communications for the PIC, explained that President Trump will also continue the official    Inaugural Ball —  a tradition started by George W. Bush and continued by Obama —  and expand that. Previously, that ball had just enlisted members of the U. S. military in attendance. Trump is going to expand that ball to include first responders like police, firefighters and EMTs —  and will also allow in veterans, military families and wounded warriors. Stroman said: Usually a president will come in and they’ll have 10 official balls in addition to the unofficial balls that happen. President Obama had 10 in 2009, President Bush in 2001 and 2005 I believe had nine balls each in addition to the unofficial balls that took place. This president is going to attend three balls. We only have three official balls. We have two that are like the official balls, and then we have a third —  it’s a tradition President Bush started in 2005 with the    ball, President Obama continued it and President Trump is also continuing it but expanding it. This ball, the general public can’t get a ticket. Historically, it’s only been active duty members of the military —  specifically enlisted members. This year, we’ve expanded it to include military families, wounded warriors, veterans, and first responders as well. So you’ll have police, firemen, who will all be there. It’ll be a thank you for them for their service to our country. Stroman explained that the extra focus is because Trump has an enormous amount of respect for all those who put their lives on the line to protect the country. He went on: I think you’ve seen that [Trump’s respect for the military, police, veterans and first responders] throughout the  ’s campaign. Some of my favorite photos are when you see every time he made a stop at his airplane, he’d stop and take photos with the police who were protecting him. This is a president, he’s vowed to be a law and order president. He respects our police, he respects our military, he respects those who put their lives on the line whether it’s firemen or EMTs or police every day. He made that a point throughout his campaign to honor these folks, veterans, military, et cetera, who put their lives on the line for our country. It’s a way to, in one of his first acts as president, to thank those who do that. Another change from previous inaugurations, Stroman said, is that the parade from the Capitol to the White House on Inauguration Day is expected to be shortened to just an hour or so. That will allow Trump to get right to work at the White House on day one, before he goes to the balls later that night. Stroman told Breitbart: You’re going to have a parade that is going to be shortened. I think Eisenhower’s parade was something like six hours long. You’ve had previous parades that are three or four hours long. This is going to be a shorter parade, an hour to hour and a half or so so he can go to work. That’s what the American people elected him to do: To go on with the traditions, he’s going to have a church service, but he’s not going to sit there for hours and then have this parade —  and of course for the people who come to Washington to watch the parade, he’s going to have a shortened parade and he’s going to go into the White House and get some work done before he goes to the balls. Again, the thinking, Stroman stressed, is that Trump wants to honor tradition while also wasting no time helping protect Americans’ safety and jobs. He said: The   is about honoring the traditions, and this is a ceremony about the American people more than any one person. You’ve seen some previous inaugurations are really lavish, you have a lot of long events, a lot of big events. This   is somebody who’s ready to get to work. So if you look at the Carrier deal, look at Sprint today, look at the Boeing and Lockheed Martin stuff. He’s already —  and this is impressive with our leadership, at least in modern times, in that there’s a transition and   who is already getting to work before he even takes office. You’re going to see that reflected in the inauguration itself. Epshteyn added that while Trump’s inauguration is a “celebration,” the focus is going to be on immediately getting to work on behalf of the American people. He said: This is a celebration. It is a celebration of freedom of democracy. There will two inaugural balls and one ball saluting armed services and first responders, which is so important. The first responders are a new addition too. This is the Commander in Chief ball, and we’re honoring first responders because those are the people who are the firefighters and in the ambulances, and the police of course —  the police who keep us safe —  this is to honor them. These exclusive interviews with Epshteyn and Stroman came as PIC staff, including press secretary Ali Pardo, provided Breitbart News with an exclusive tour of the PIC offices in the General Services Administration (GSA) building near L’Enfant Plaza in Washington, D. C. The sprawling offices represent the beachhead of Trump’s looming takeover of the federal government, a culture very different from business as usual in government offices in Washington, D. C.        The halls of the GSA building’s PIC corridors are decorated with Trump trophies, including a series of photo spreads of his rallies. A white board in one of the government offices has #MAGA —  the Twitter hashtag for the “Make America Great Again” campaign slogan —  scribbled on it, while the official inaugural seal of the incoming president and vice president is on each of the doors. Make America Great hats line desks inside the communications office, as well.      In addition to the Trump rally photo spreads showing thousands of his supporters, the hallway is adorned with a giant ceramic   elephant —  complete with red legs and white stars inside its blue body.    Stroman notes that the building and the space technically are not funded by taxpayers, except for minimal building costs from the GSA. He said: The entire building is two city blocks long on each side. We’re in a GSA building, a GSA location, and the GSA for the last couple inaugurals by statute have given PIC access to the building for office space to support. They do the same thing for the transition. It’s a fairly new thing. They come in and they allow us to operate inside the government building, but we’re a 501( c)4 so we’re a not for profit. It’s not a government entity. Very few taxpayer dollars are expended except for allowing us to be in a building and turning on the lights and giving us temporary office furniture that’s pretty low key. Since the PIC is a nonprofit charged with putting together Inauguration Day and week, it fundraises —  without lobbyists, Stroman says, since the   wants no lobbyists involved —  to pay for the events. He went on to explain: We fundraise, we’ve capped donations at a million dollars. No funds from lobbyists, but we do take individual and corporation dollars —  but the interesting point about that and the reason why that’s so important is because the underwriters are the ones who allow the general public to come and attend these and make sure we aren’t using taxpayer dollars for the ceremony. It’s a group of folks who underwrite the expenses of the inaugural committee and the parade and the stands and the security and the fencing and renting the ballrooms and these people allow it so we can keep prices free or cheap. I wouldn’t say that’s unique to ours but people kind of think the inauguration itself is kind of exclusive. But the inauguration is for the people and that’s something this president especially has given the charge to this committee to make sure. The tickets along the parade route, the majority of the parade route is open to the public. We’ll do a welcome concert on Thursday evening and while there will be ticketed guests the majority of those tickets will be free. And then in addition to the free tickets, you just have to request a ticket, there will be places for the public to watch if they’re just driving up to Washington. If you’re driving up, people can come to Washington and celebrate this historic inauguration, celebrate this president and do it with minimal cost. Stroman noted that the role of the PIC is to help the transition have a successful Inauguration Day so that President Trump’s first 100 days can get off the starting block without a hitch —  and he can get rolling into setting up the government. The PIC deputy director said: The Presidential Inaugural Committee’s role is to plan any event outside of the actual swearing in ceremony. It’s to plan the balls, the parade, any kind of private events, family events, and then also does have a hand in the swearing in ceremony itself. It represents the  ’s and the vice  ’s interests in the ceremony itself as well, but also everything surrounding the inauguration. It’s interesting because our charge from the   is to help set up that kickoff point to that first 100 days. You have the transition that takes place immediately after and through the inauguration itself with the selection of cabinet appointees and kind of setting the initial messaging. Then you have us, whose job is to be that first picture from the second he raises his hand to take the oath of office through the rest of that day and that weekend. So they all kind of three work together. You have the presidential transition, the inaugural committee, and that first 100 days aspect of the administration. I feel it’s our job to tie those three areas together, the transition and the kickoff of the first 100 days which is what the inauguration is. Expectations, he added, are that about a half a million people —  maybe more —  might make their way to Washington to witness the historic event in person. Stroman went on: We haven’t put out any official numbers on our end here at PIC, but planners outside of PIC are saying probably a half a million or so. But I think the enthusiasm whether it’s folks who make their way to D. C. or folks watching from around the world, I think it’s going to be the biggest event ever. If you look at his rallies where he tens of thousands —  hundreds of thousands —  of people at rallies all across the country, the amount of interest you’ve seen around the world in the first person to be   and no government service ever elected. So the interest all around the country and around the world is high. Pardo noted, too, that the PIC’s media team is working overtime to ensure that the hundreds of millions of Americans who won’t be able to make it to Washington for the inauguration festivities —  and the billions worldwide —  can get a front row seat to the action using media tools. “We’re also making sure we’re providing that for people who aren’t here, through technology —  we’re being innovating,” Pardo said. “We’re trying to make sure everybody across the country has a seat to this historic day. Anyone can access it whether it’s on social media or watching it on the news, but we want to make sure everyone has the ability to watch this historic event across the country and around the world. ”"
379,How Yelp Reviews Can Help Improve Patient Care - The New York Times,2016-09-17,"Hospitals and many insurance carriers care about patient satisfaction. It especially matters to hospitals because insurance payments can be influenced by how patients rate the care they receive, as well as by the health of the patient, which hospitals usually report. Many people in the health care profession are put off by this. They argue that patient satisfaction scores aren’t necessarily aligned with outcomes. Moreover, they say that trying to improve satisfaction is a waste of time. It’s possible, however, that patient satisfaction is being rewarded already, and that the efforts we are making to highlight it aren’t helping as much as we think. Almost every study on patient satisfaction uses the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (H. C. A. H. P. S.) survey. Studies show it is correlated with clinical measures of quality, although some other studies dispute this. Collecting such information is costly, but there may be other sources for quality assessments that don’t require investment from the health care system. In 2012, researchers in the Journal of General Internal Medicine examined online reviews from RateMDs. com and Yelp. They found that a majority of reviews were positive. They noted, however, that patients reported on aspects of care that extended beyond the   encounter. They were concerned about staff, access to the hospital and convenience. They also cared greatly about the bedside manner of the doctors they encountered. Dr. Naomi Bardach, associate professor of pediatrics and health policy at U. C. S. F. Benioff Children’s Hospital San Francisco, and her colleagues looked at Yelp to determine how consumer ratings compared with those of the hospital consumer assessment survey. Of the almost 3, 800 hospitals with survey and other data, about 25 percent also had ratings on Yelp. The correlation between Yelp and the survey was quite strong. Moreover, high ratings at Yelp were correlated with lower mortality for myocardial infarctions and pneumonia  —   and fewer readmissions for those problems as well as heart failure. A recent study in Health Affairs expanded on this work. Researchers compared the content of Yelp narrative reviews with the factors considered important in the hospital consumer assessment survey. They found that Yelp reviews did cover most things the survey tallied. But they also covered an additional 12 criteria not in the survey. These included the cost of a visit insurance and billing scheduling compassion of staff family member care and the quality of many staff members. All of these things were important to patients, and all might be correlated with outcomes. More important, nine of the 15 most prevalent criteria in reviews were not included in the survey. The use of metrics like the hospital consumer assessment survey assumes that those in the health care system have figured out how best to measure patient satisfaction. They also assume that all the information we need should come from patients or from the medical record. That’s not how the real world works. In a more recent study, Dr. Bardach found that the perceptions of other family members matter and can also be powerful because they focus on safety in a way that patients may not be able to do. The same is true of those who help care for patients at home and help make medical decisions for them. Their opinions are ignored by the survey. Those publicly available data may even be more comprehensive than that gathered at the behest of payers. The next question is whether the health care system needs to measure satisfaction  —   maybe the publicly available data, like at Yelp, is sufficient. Could those data be used alone to incentivize providers? A couple of weeks ago, my colleague Austin Frakt wrote a column on hospital quality and market share. He argued that people could improve their health by choosing a hospital that has a higher quality rating. He also underscored that patient satisfaction scores are often aligned with quality and with better outcomes. He highlighted a paper published in The American Economic Review that looked at how performance of hospitals was related to market share. Conventional wisdom holds that patients lack information on quality and that they cannot tell, or favor, providers who seem better. But researchers found that hospitals that performed better, on both outcomes and   measures, tended to have greater market share, and experienced greater market growth. Further, they found that as patients shifted to hospitals with higher performance, that change alone drove a significant amount in the improvements seen in overall survival rates for a number of conditions. Overall survival improved, in part, just because patients shifted from hospitals with lower quality to higher quality. If patients had the ability to choose between hospitals, they tended to gravitate to those with higher performance. In other words, this may be an area of health care where the free market is working. When allowed to choose, patients seem able to discern quality  —   as they define it  —   and gravitate toward it. It’s not clear that we need to be forcing the issue with measurement and reimbursement. It’s important to recognize, though, that this was a study of Medicare patients, all of whom arguably have more flexibility in terms of hospitals and doctors than those with private insurance. Those with private insurance often are restricted by “narrow networks” and directed to a few facilities and offices. Americans cry out for more choice in their health care. This sometimes gets translated to mean a choice of insurance companies. But Americans with   Medicare, who have the least choice of insurers, have the most choices when it comes to providers. And they seem to use that freedom to choose providers who perform better. I asked Dr. Bardach about this. “It’s still unclear how people are getting the information to choose the hospitals, but the power of stories is likely an important part of why Yelp and other online reviews are compelling,” she said. “Stories add nuance and context to the otherwise somewhat sterile numbers that the H. C. A. H. P. S. produces. ” Research shows that patients reward quality on their own  —   when they can. We might just need to make it easier for more of them to do so."
380,"Italy Reacts to Migrant Crisis by Accelerating Asylum, Deportations - Breitbart",2017-04-14,"The Italian parliament has signed into law a series of provisions designed to streamline the processing of asylum requests as well as the deportations of those whose requests are rejected. [As Breitbart News reported Thursday, the number of migrants arriving in Italy in the first quarter of 2017 has exceeded the previous record number by a remarkable 30 percent, and Italy’s infrastructure for dealing with migrants has been stretched to the breaking point.  The     immigration law, named after its sponsors, Interior Minister Marco Minniti and Justice Minister Andrea Orlando, introduces several new features, such as the creation of new centers for repatriation, the elimination of the possibility of a second appeal, and a reduction of the time required for processing an asylum request. The new law allocates 19 million euros to expedite the deportation of asylum applicants who have been turned down. The new holding centers for repatriation with a capacity of 1, 600 persons will be established generally outside urban centers and close to transport infrastructure. The new measures have been praised by leaders of conservative parties such as the Northern League, but they still do not address the fundamental problem of daily arrivals of hundreds of new immigrants by sea. In recent weeks, Italy’s failure to deal with the constant flow of economic migrants leaving from North Africa has drawn considerable criticism, even from groups such as Frontex, the European agency in charge of control of the EU’s borders. In a report released in March, Frontex accused NGOs and other humanitarian organizations of providing a shuttle service for migrants from Africa to Europe, and in this way becoming accomplices of human traffickers by lowering their costs and improving their “business model. ” The presence of rescue vessels ready to transport migrants to Italy has created a significant “pull factor,” the report stated, significantly increasing the number of migrants who dare to attempt the crossing. “Migrants and refugees  —   encouraged by the stories of those who had successfully made it in the past  —   attempt the dangerous crossing since they are aware of and rely on humanitarian assistance to reach the EU,” the report said. Following the release of the report, an Italian public prosecutor pointed out the obvious: that rescue vessels should not be ferrying migrants to Italy in the first place, but to a nearer port, as established by international accords. Carmelo Zuccaro, the chief prosecutor of Catania (Sicily) noted that while it is not a crime to invade the waters of a foreign country to pick migrants up, it is a crime to illegally transport them to Italy. “What is punishable is bringing them to Italy without respecting the rules of engagement, which establish that vessels should take migrants to the nearest port, which is certainly not Italy,” he said. Italy will spend some 3. 9 billion euros ($4. 1 billion) on managing immigration this year alone, almost three times as much as in 2013. Follow Thomas D. Williams on Twitter  Follow @tdwilliamsrome"

Mike Pence ( ) said Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s speech last week about the   movement cast “racist intention” on millions of Americans.  Pence said, “I think Sen. Kaine’s comments, Hillary Clinton’s comments on Thursday night sound desperate to me. I mean, to be honest with you. I don’t talk a lot about the polls, Jake, but I know the polls are all closing up. And the fact that you see Democrats and Hillary Clinton and her running mate rolling out the same old playbook of racial divisiveness, sounds a little bit to me like an act of desperation. I mean, look, the American people are sick and tired of politicians who seek to divide the people of this country, to unite their supporters. ” He added, “Hillary Clinton literally condemned not just Donald Trump, by the same terms, but also millions of Americans who long for a better future   …     I think she was calling millions of Americans around this country who believe we can make America great again, who believe that Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama’s policies have weakened America’s place in the world and stifled America’s economy, she has put some sort of racist intention those Americans.

382,Mia Hamm: The most powerful woman in football?,2015-02-05," (CNN) She’s one of the most powerful women in football after cracking one of sports’ most notorious glass ceilings, but even Mia Hamm is not immune from the demands of domestic drudgery. Follow us on Twitter, @CNNSport, and Like us on Facebook. ”Sorry for all of the noise,” she says as the clatter of workmen and screaming kids crackles down the phone line. ”The people who were supposed to be here 30 minutes ago to fix our carpets have just shown up!” A proud mother of    twin girls and a baby boy, Hamm was for the best part of two decades America’s foremost footballer. Though the World Cup winner and double Olympic gold medalist    described as ”the biggest U. S.  soccer star of all time”    is swift to laugh off such lofty titles. ”I’m just a former player that every day has to wake up, get her kids to school and figure out what I’m making them for lunch and dinner,” the    Hamm, who played for the U. S. women’s team on over 200 occasions between 1987 and 2004, told CNN. However, it’s not just the school run and her kids’ packed lunches that Hamm has on her mind these days. Appointed to the board of directors at major Italian club Roma, she occupies a position within the sport that few other women can match. As well as her role in the ”Eternal City,” the Alabama native is a minority owner of the   Los Angeles Football Club (LAFC)    which will join Major League Soccer (MLS) in 2017. ”I never stand up there and say ’I’m doing this to get more women in football,’” says Hamm of her appointment at Roma, which is owned by Italian American investor James Pallotta. ”But I take pride in the fact and I look at it as a great responsibility to make sure I do the best job I can. ”I personally didn’t say yes just to tick a box. I think they will soon learn that I have opinions, I have ideas.” Hamm’s links to the Italian capital go beyond the boardroom. Her parents lived in the city for over four years when she was younger, with her father    an Air Force pilot    working at the U. S. embassy in Rome. That was when Hamm first became aware of the team affectionately known as the ”Giallorossi” (the  ). ”It was one of the clubs I could follow on the local TV,” she explains. ”It was the colors I would see when I would walk around Rome. ”So my holidays, Christmas and a couple of weeks over summer were spent over in Rome. AS Roma was the team I started following then.” Pallotta, who took over Roma in 2012, has grand ambitions for the club that include the construction of a new   stadium for the   Italian champions. The Bostonian’s vision appealed to Hamm, who hopes to raise the club’s international profile    especially in the U. S. She wants to ensure that ”when people are talking about their favorite teams, AS Roma is one of the teams that comes out of their mouth” and hopes the club continues its recent trend of touring the U. S. during the European offseason. ”I’d love to be a part of that and helping get the fan support,” she insists. ”Even though I know there’s an incredible fan support here for Roma.” Hamm’s own relationship with the game dates back to her childhood when, perhaps surprisingly, she had a hard time convincing her coach to let her play. That coach also happened to be her dad, and the eager Hamm was barely out of diapers. ”I wasn’t allowed to play organized soccer until I turned five,” says Hamm. ”I had an older brother and a sister that were a year apart. They were on the same team and my dad happened to be coaching them.  ”I just remember standing on the sidelines, collecting balls for them when they went wide of the goal, hoping my dad would say, ’Hey Mia, do you want to jump in?’  ”Those are some of the early memories, hanging out with older siblings, getting beat up by them and their friends at practice but loving it.  ”I just wanted to belong to a team.” Read: AC Milan unveils grand designs for futuristic stadium, Eventually her father relented and finally let the precocious ball girl enter the fray.  Hamm didn’t look back. Her glittering career saw the prolific goalscorer help grow football in the U. S. firstly as the youngest member of the team which won the inaugural Women’s World Cup in 1991. Olympic glory followed as Hamm added a gold medal to her resume in front of fervent home support at the 1996 Altanta Games. Three years later    once again on home soil    Hamm scored in a tense penalty shootout as the U. S. narrowly beat China at the Pasadena Rose Bowl to lift the World Cup for a second time. Fast forward to Athens 2004 and she became a double Olympic champion, having added a silver medal to her collection of precious metals at the 2000 Games in Sydney. Hamm’s experiences within such successful teams had a profound effect on her as she grew in confidence, learned how to work with others, while also boosting her  . Above all, she learned how to handle failure. ”We have two daughters of our own who are about seven and a half and I just see the excitement,” she explains, ”the lessons that they are learning every single time they go out there. ”It’s no surprise to me. You look across the board, not just with female athletes but with Fortune 500 companies, and women that are in top executive positions all played some kind of sports growing up. They talk about the empowerment they felt. ”Getting kids up and motivated and then all of the wonderful things they experience and learn through sport are so important. Much more than you would ever get sat in front of your TV.” As well as her Roma role, Hamm is part of a band of celebrities who have signed up as minority owners of LAFC, a new team hoping to act as rivals to Los Angeles Galaxy, which won its fifth championship in 2014. NBA legend ”Magic” Johnson and Hamm’s husband Nomar Garciaparra, a former pro baseball player, are both part of a   ownership team. The continued expansion of MLS    which commissioner Don Garber hopes will swell to 24 teams by 2020    is proof of soccer’s growing popularity in the U. S. with women forming part of the professional ranks. Formed in 2013, the National Women’s Soccer League (NWSL) allows eight teams to vie for domestic glory, a welcome development following multiple false starts for the female game in America, the most recent setback arriving when Women’s Professional Soccer ceased operations in 2012. Although the country also boasts the Women’s Premier Soccer League    which houses both professional and amateur teams    Hamm hopes the NWSL can cement itself on the nation’s sporting landscape. ”The success of the MLS will help the NWSL,” insists Hamm. ”The success of the U. S. national teams will help the NWSL. ”There are several teams that are tied to MLS clubs and that could be the potential for the future where we’re able to share facilities, share infrastructure.” So when LAFC enters the league, will it also boast a women’s team? ”Don’t know yet,” says a candid Hamm. ”For me, it just makes sense, in one of the largest hotbed of girls’ club soccer in the country, if not the world. ”Being a part of the ownership group, we have a lot of work ahead of us. The women’s team isn’t their first priority, but I want it to be in the conversation.  ”I’m going to make sure it’s something that’s discussed consistently because it’s the right thing to do and this area will support it. There are so many talented players in this area, up and down the coast.” As far as Hamm is concerned, the future of U. S. soccer is bright    regardless of gender. ”I’m always hopeful, I love the game too much,” she says. ”It doesn’t mean I’m naive, but I want the game to succeed in this country and the women’s side is a huge part of that.”"
383,Gingrich: Indiana ’Life or Death’ For Cruz - Breitbart,2016-05-01,"On the Fox News Channel’s “Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo,” former Speaker Newt Gingrich said Republican presidential candidate Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) must win “virtually all the delegates” in the upcoming Indiana primary to have a chance at securing the GOP nomination.  Gingrich said, “Indiana is make or break for Cruz, and it’s a bump in the road for Trump. If Cruz can’t win Indiana, and by win I mean, get virtually all the delegates, do something like close to what he did in Wisconsin, there’s no possibility that he can stop Trump. It’ll just be over sometime Wednesday morning. On the other hand, if Trump doesn’t do particularly well in Indiana, he has so much overall momentum, and it’s such a huge lead that he could still win by winning in New Jersey and California on June 7. So, for Trump it is a significant event. For Cruz, it’s life and death. ” Follow Pam Key On Twitter @pamkeyNEN"
384,Kenyan Athletics Manager Recalled after Doping Bribe Report - Breitbart,2016-08-07,"London (AFP)  —   The manager of the Kenyan Olympic athletics team has been recalled from the Rio Games after an investigation alleged he demanded money to give warnings about doping tests, a media report said.  The investigation by the Sunday Times newspaper and German television channel ARD into Michael Rotich is a potential new blow to Kenya’s sporting reputation after doping accusations in recent months. Rotich was filmed by the two media demanding 10, 000 pounds ($800 euros) for agreeing to warn a British coach about imminent doping tests. ARD journalist Hajo Seppelt tweeted an Athletics Kenya statement saying Rotich had been recalled “so we can investigate further his role in this. ” “These are very serious allegations and we cannot have someone of that character managing our team. ” The statement said the case could be referred to Kenyan police. Rotich introduced reporters purporting to be the coach and an agent of athletes to Paul and Liz Scott, who are official   testers in Kenya.  —   Round figure  —   The retired school teachers work for a   company which has the IAAF contract for doping tests in Kenya. There was no suggestion of misconduct against them. The company said Rotich was not one of their business contacts. Joseph Mwangi, one of three medical experts arrested after an earlier Sunday   investigation this year, recommended the reporters meet Rotich. “He loves money. So, if you know somebody’s weakness, it is easier to work with him,” Mwangi, who had agreed to procure blood doping EPO for the fictitious British group, was quoted as saying. Rotich reportedly told a Sunday Times reporter he would try to work out the easiest way the purported coach’s athletes could avoid being tested. Asked whether he would warn Mwangi of imminent tests, he answered: “Yeah I will tell him. Any time, any time. ” At another meeting the next day, over champagne, the demand for the money was made, the report said. “Ten (thousand pounds) would be a round figure just for the whole thing,” Rotich was quoted as saying. He had been offered three monthly payments of £3, 000. For the money, Rotich said he would give Mwangi 12 hours warning of doping tests and suggested how athletes could explain their absence if they felt they had not had enough time to rid their body of blood doping EPO. “I mean some of those compassionate ones like you had a sick child and you  …     slept in the hospital or something,” said Rotich. He also suggested saying that the sudden illness of a close relative had compelled the athlete to go away. When he left for Rio, Rotich told the media: “We have counselled, taught and even asked them to be cautious about doping. We want to show the world our bid for clean sport. ” When confronted by The Sunday Times, Rotich claimed he had gone along with the plan as he was investigating Mwangi and the reporter. “There were a lot of white people  …     who were actually moving drugs and doing all those things. So this was an opportunity,” he told the reporter. Several Kenyan athletes have failed dope tests in recent months. The government only this week passed   legislation so that the World   Agency could take Kenya off its   list."
385,Twitter Bans Gay Conservative Milo After Anti-Islam Tweets **UPDATE** Twitter Caves - Breitbart,2016-06-15,"**UPDATE** Following tremendous backlash, Milo Yiannopoulos’ Twitter account has been restored. [Original story:  Conservative commentator and Breitbart Tech editor Milo Yiannopoulos has been suspended from Twitter ahead of a planned press conference in Orlando, Florida.  The timing of this suspension cannot be ignored. Yiannopoulos was planning to give a press conference today near the Pulse dance club in Orlando, the target of a deadly Muslim terrorist attack that left over 100 dead or wounded. The event is still scheduled to take place, outside the Christ Church Of Orlando at 2pm EDT. Full details for those wishing to attend can be found at the bottom of this article.  It comes as a number of other figures, great and small, have been censored on social media for being too outspoken about the threat of Islam in the wake of the shootings. Islam critic Pamela Geller was suspended on Facebook. A games developer who called for the surveillance of radical mosques was suspended on Twitter. Masses of users discussing the shooting were censored on Reddit. Jim Hoft, aka “The Gateway Pundit,” another gay conservative activists who recently called on LGBT people to acknowledge the homophobia of Islam and “come home to the Republican party,” was suspended on YouTube.  And now Milo Yiannopoulos has been censored on Twitter. The pattern is clear.  “America has to make a very simple choice here. This is not a question of fine distinctions politicians and our media make between Islam and radical Islamist terrorists, really it’s all the same thing, there is a structural problem with Islam, most of them don’t like gays very much. This isn’t news to anyone except our media. ” said Milo yesterday on the Todd Shapiro show. Perhaps it is Milos outspoken opinion on this subject that has had him removed from Twitters already restrictive platform.   It is not yet entirely clear why Milo has been suspended but it is unsurprising that this has happened mere days after Milo tweeted his condemnation of Islamic culture and it’s opinions of homosexuals. Yiannopoulos has been highly outspoken in his condemnation of Islam following the Orlando attacks, and recently wrote a viral article slamming the left for “choosing Islam over gays. ”  This is not the first time that Yiannopoulos has been targeted by Twitter staff. Many of our readers will remember the saga that was Milo losing his verification check mark earlier this year. Twitter has a history of punishing those that hold conservative views on its platform, mainly through the process of “shadowbanning”  —   hiding conservative views from users Twitter timelines  —   Milo himself has previously reported on. Those wishing to attend Milo’s press conference in Orlando, Florida today gather outside Christ Church of Orlando, at 2200 South Orange Avenue at 2pm EDT. All members of the public and press are welcome to attend, and should contact tim@yiannopoulos. net with further questions. Yiannopoulos will take questions from attending media and listeners, expected to include the New York Times, local television stations, Deutsche Welle, PBS and various student publications. The Breitbart team will be accompanied by private security, for the safety of media and the attending public."
386,The $7 plan bringing solar power to Tanzania,2016-12-15," (CNN) In   Africa, over 600 million people do not have access to electricity    that’s 68 percent of the population, according to the International Energy Agency. That’s because the power distribution infrastructure    plants and the grid    is severely underdeveloped, requires large investments to improve and ultimately can’t keep up with the growth in demand. One solution to the problem is to go ”off the grid,” mimicking the rapid distribution of mobile phones: over 90 percent of Africans have access to cell phone service    more than have access to clean water    but only a fraction of them owns a landline. In the energy sector, the cellphone equivalent is the solar panel, which is easily installed and can provide power to a household or small business. Off Grid Electric, an African startup, is applying this formula to rural areas of Tanzania and Rwanda yielding both commercial success and   results for the recipients. 125, 000 households, The company is backed by Elon Musk’s SolarCity, one of the largest solar energy providers in the US, and Helios, Africa’s largest private equity firm.  In November, at the UN’s climate change conference in Marrakech, it won the 2016 Momentum for Change Award, which focused on projects that are addressing climate change in innovative ways. It already powers 125, 000 households and employs around 1, 000 people    about a third as salesmen who offer the energy packages door to door. ”Most of these families were burning kerosene to make light, with a negative impact on their health and wellbeing,” Bill Lenihan, Off Grid Electric’s President, told CNN. Kerosene produces smoke and can’t power anything but a lantern: ”Now they have access to clean energy that can also power radios and TVs.” The system includes a solar panel, installed on a roof, and   battery which provides electricity around the clock: ”Kids can study at night, entrepreneurs can increase their income because their phones work all day and farmers can better protect their cattle    it’s like night and day,” said Kim Schreiber, the company’s chief of staff. $7 a month, There are three different sizes of photovoltaic panels, the smallest of which can power four lights and charge one mobile phone. ”We also provide all the energy efficient accessories that go with these, from lights to chargers, to radios and TVs,” said Lenihan. Customers pay 10 percent of their package upfront, the rest is financed through monthly installments. The costs are competitive, according to Off Grid Electric: ”Just connecting to the grid can cost $300 to $400, whereas our system is $7 a month and after three years you own it and never have to pay again,” said Schreiber. Larger packages cost more: for eight lights, a radio and a   TV, the monthly fee is about $20. In comparison, a month’s supply of kerosene typically costs $4 to $5. The payments are collected via mobile phone transactions, a popular method in the continent, and a   service plan is included if something breaks. The battery can last seven years, and the panel itself up to 20. In case a customer can’t keep up with the plan, Off Grid Electric says it offers ”room for flexibility,” and ultimately the system will be removed after several months of missed installments. But most customers stay on board, according to Lenihan: ”The uptake has been very strong, people continue to pay, and the growth has been really good.” A trillion dollar challenge, Providing electricity to people in   Africa is ”a cottage industry and a trillion dollar challenge,” said Lenihan. ”We can solve a problem and do it in a way that delivers a return to shareholders, which is the biggest challenge in an industry that, as a whole, has addressed less than 1 percent of this market,” he said. For small businesses, the company offers a package called Zola, which contains everything needed to run a business on solar power, including appliances and entertainment systems. Off Grid Electric has recently signed a partnership with EDF, the world’s largest utility, to expand the program to the Ivory Coast, with a goal of providing clean energy to 2 million people by 2020.

387,"Salah Abdeslam, Suspect in Paris Attacks, Is Extradited to France - The New York Times",2016-04-28,"PARIS  —   Salah Abdeslam, thought to be the only direct participant in November’s Paris attacks to have survived, was handed over to France by Belgium on Wednesday, prosecutors in both countries said. He was later charged in a French court with murder connected to terrorism, participation in a terrorist conspiracy and possession of weapons and explosives, the Paris prosecutor’s office announced. Mr. Abdeslam, who is also believed to be connected to the attacks in Brussels last month, was the subject of a European arrest warrant, which simplified the extradition between the two European Union countries. “Within the framework of the Paris attacks of the 13th of November 2015, Salah Abdeslam has been surrendered to the French authorities this morning,” the Belgian federal prosecutor’s office said in a statement. The Paris prosecutor’s office said Mr. Abdeslam arrived in French territory at 9:05 a. m. Frank Berton, Mr. Abdeslam’s French lawyer, said he had been brought to France under heavy escort by a helicopter from the   prison where he was being detained, in Beveren, Belgium. The French justice minister,   Urvoas, said after a cabinet meeting that Mr. Abdeslam would be held in isolation in a prison in the Paris region. Mr. Abdeslam, 26, is believed to have been part of a team of 10 Islamic State operatives who carried out a series of shootings and suicide bombings in Paris, and in the northern suburb of St.  on the evening of Nov. 13, killing 130 people and wounding more than 400. A French citizen of Moroccan ancestry who lived in Belgium, Mr. Abdeslam fled Paris for Brussels in the early hours of Nov. 14. He was the target of a   international manhunt before he was arrested on March 18 in the Molenbeek neighborhood of Brussels, his hometown. Mr. Abdeslam ran a bar there with his brother Ibrahim, who detonated a suicide vest in the Comptoir Voltaire cafe in central Paris on Nov. 13. French and Belgian investigators have found evidence suggesting that Mr. Abdeslam was heavily involved in preparations for the Paris attacks. He rented cars and at least one safe house, bought material used in explosives and drove across Europe to pick up other suspects. But Mr. Abdeslam’s exact role on the night of the attacks is still unclear. Experts have questioned how valuable he will be to investigators in France, though the French authorities and families of the victims have expressed relief that a surviving participant in the attacks will stand trial. He is suspected of driving three suicide bombers to the Stade de France soccer stadium in St.  and investigators are still trying to establish whether he had intended to carry out another attack. Shortly after his arrest, Mr. Abdeslam told investigators that he had “backed out” of carrying out a suicide bombing against the Stade de France. Mr. Berton said Tuesday said that Mr. Abdeslam had to be judged “for what he has done and not for what he represents, because he is the last survivor and some would blame him for deeds and actions that are not his. ” In an interview with the French newspaper Libération, Sven Mary, Mr. Abdeslam’s lawyer in Belgium, was more disparaging, characterizing his client as a “little jerk from Molenbeek” and as a petty criminal."

389,Online Trail Illuminates Baton Rouge Gunman’s Path to Violence - The New York Times,2016-08-22,"BATON ROUGE, La.  —   He joined the Marines, served in Iraq and earned a Good Conduct Medal. He was an entrepreneur, a   author, a nutrition and fitness counselor, a proponent of the American gospel of  . He considered himself a lifestyle coach, even though he had failed in marriage, neglected to pay his taxes and was, at one point, living on $500 per month. He had also embarked on a spiritual quest to find his roots as a black man, traveling around Africa for two years. But Gavin Long’s life also became a web of paranoid ideas, a professed allegiance to an antigovernment “sovereign citizen” group and a belief that bloodshed was a better tool than peaceful protest in the fight against oppression. On Sunday, Mr. Long died in a parking lot just off a commercial street here in a shootout with the police. It was his 29th birthday. He killed three law enforcement officers and wounded three others. On Monday, law enforcement officials said Mr. Long had targeted officers, though his motives otherwise remained murky. Mr. Long had been a resident of Kansas City, Mo. and it is unclear what he was doing in Baton Rouge, though a video that appears to have been posted by him shows him in the Louisiana capital discussing the July 5 fatal police shooting of a fellow   man, Alton B. Sterling, here. Though the police here have released little information about Mr. Long, a deeper portrait is beginning to emerge, based on a large trail left online. Many of these digital bread crumbs  —   web posts, YouTube videos and podcasts  —   are tied to Mr. Long’s given name, or some version of a new name, Cosmo Ausar Setepenra, which he filed court documents in Missouri to adopt in May 2015. (He never petitioned the court, so the name change was not legally binding, officials said.) Some of these posts and videos included biographical and personal information that aligned with the information released by the authorities. In an interview with a podcast host in March, Mr. Long identified himself as a member of the online community of   targeted individuals, people who believe they are being harassed with   weapons and by armies of stalkers. And in one YouTube video, he discusses the killings of   men at the hands of police officers, including the death of Mr. Sterling, and advocates a bloody response instead of the protests that followed the deaths. “One hundred percent of revolutions, of victims fighting their oppressors,” Mr. Long said, “have been successful through fighting back, through bloodshed. Zero have been successful just over simply protesting. ” “You’ve got to stand on your rights, just like George Washington did, just like the other white rebels they celebrate and salute did,” he added. “That’s what Nat Turner did. That’s what Malcolm did. ” In Baton Rouge on Monday, the crime scene along Airline Highway was returning to normal. Bullet holes could be seen in a wall of the Hair Crown Beauty Supply store, where the shooting took place. The city had begun the process of mourning the police officers Mr. Long gunned down  —   including Montrell Jackson, 32, an   and   veteran of the Baton Rouge Police Department, who left behind a wife and son. On a podcast posted on iTunes and dated April, the speaker, who gives his name as Cosmo, gives a sketch of his life story. He says he grew up in Kansas City, and was a   student until about middle school, when he became fat and started getting C’s. As a child, he was something of a hustler who made extra money by making loans and charging interest. “Say if I loaned out money to my family, even to my mother, I would make her pay me back, with interest,” he says. “If I loaned $20, I would make you pay me back $5 on Friday. ” He says he lost significant weight in high school, bought his first car at age 16 and joined the Marines. Mr. Long’s military records show he served from 2005 to 2010, including a   deployment in Iraq. He was a sergeant and a data network specialist who earned several awards, including one for good conduct. He was also assigned to Okinawa, Japan, and several locations in Southern California. He attended Central Texas College at its Marine Corps Air Station Miramar site in San Diego and via distance education, earning an associate of arts degree. In 2011, court records show, he had an uncontested divorce from a woman named Aireyona Osha Hill. They listed that they had no children or assets and that Mr. Long earned $500 a month. Around this time, Mr. Long befriended a Kansas City schoolteacher who wished to remain anonymous because of the heinous nature of the shootings. The teacher said Mr. Long had taken interest in the Occupy Wall Street movement and   culture, and sympathized with the views of the villain Bane, from the 2012 Batman film “The Dark Knight Rises”  —   particularly Bane’s vigilantism against corruption. But the man the teacher knew never spoke about violent solutions to the real world’s problems. “I’m surprised he took it as far as he did,” the teacher said Monday. “It doesn’t surprise me so much as he had an agenda against the government. He’d always talk about how the government was corrupt. ” By 2012, Mr. Long had moved  —   briefly, apparently  —   to Tuscaloosa, Ala. where he spent one semester at the University of Alabama. He majored in business. He made the dean’s list. The University of Alabama police had no interactions with him during his time there. Mike Mansur, a spokesman for the Jackson County prosecutor’s office, which covers most of Kansas City, said his office also had no record of contact with Mr. Long. He also attended Clark Atlanta University during the   school year, and was in good academic standing, a university spokeswoman said. Although he claimed to be on the dean’s list there, he said he had dropped out, sold his two cars, gave away his possessions and traveled to Africa. Mr. Long appeared to be obsessed with the idea of   for himself and for others, and he embraced more esoteric means of achieving those goals. While traveling to Burkina Faso, Egypt, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda, he said, he wrote three books, covering topics like “holistic detoxification for health,   and success” the “ancient esoteric secrets of the Pineal Gland” and the “124 Universal Laws and their use in the Laws of the Cosmos. ” In 2015, Mr. Long filed the petition to change his name. In his statement of intent, he said he was a member of an “indigenous society” called the United Washitaw De Dugdahmoundyah Mu’ur nation. It was apparently a reference to the Empire Washitaw De Dugdahmoundyah. On its website, the group says it is “a multicultural, highly spiritual nation of aboriginal, indigenous Americans. ” The group is largely   and subscribes to a “sovereign citizen” ideology holding that members are “no longer beholden to any form of government,” said Ryan Lenz, a senior writer for the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks extremist groups. On Monday morning, a man who answered a phone number on the website and said he was a leader of the group, Fredrix Joe Washington, said he had never heard of Mr. Long. “We are about peace  —   and especially not about going out and killing some police officers,” said Mr. Washington, 71. This year, court records show, a case was filed against Mr. Long for not paying his local earnings tax. Papers in that case were served on his address last month, and his mother accepted them, according to court records. Six days later, the tax case was dismissed. In many of his podcasts, Mr. Long expounds at length on dating and   tips for men, arguing that they must display the characteristics of an “alpha” male. But a number of his other online offerings discuss the historical oppression of minorities, and America’s current racial problems. In a recent email he sent out to those interested in his ideas, he listed numerous instances of massacres of   people. On July 8, Lance Scurvin, a podcast host in Orlando, Fla. posted a note from Mr. Long on his Facebook page that seemed to suggest that Mr. Long was feeling paranoid about his safety. Mr. Scurvin, who is known for lending a sympathetic ear to   guests, had interviewed Mr. Long in the past. “I just want everyone to know that if anything may happen to me or with me, I am NOT affiliated with anybody, any group, nationality, association, religion, corporation, business, etc. ” the note said. Mr. Long traveled to Dallas after the killing of five police officers at a demonstration there on July 7. Chanattra Long, who is not related to Mr. Long, said he had come into her shop, the His and Hers Barber Shop, two days after that shooting and passed out copies of his book. “He pulled out a wad of money and said: ‘You think this is something? This is nothing,’” she recalled. She said he had spoken of being in Africa and of being able to speak five languages. She was startled at his boldness and assertiveness. She had never seen him before and had no idea why he entered her shop that day. “I could tell he wasn’t right, his demeanor, his aggressiveness,” she said. Still, Mr. Long made no mention of attacking police, she said. One of Mr. Long’s last videos, posted to YouTube but taken down as of Monday, shows him driving around Baton Rouge. He approaches a number of   strangers apparently, and doles out stray nuggets of advice and wisdom, deploying the salty language of the street. He refers to himself as a life coach, a freedom strategist, a real estate entrepreneur, an author, a teacher and a motivational speaker. And he tells them about his book. “I want my people to succeed,” he says at one point. Later, he refers to “Arabs” and “Indians” who do not care about people, ostensibly   except when the latter give them their money. At one point he uses the word “cracker,” apparently in reference to whites. He also makes a passing reference to the shooting of Mr. Sterling. “It’s two parts to freedom, bruh,” he says. “Knowing your rights and standing on your rights. They know we know our rights. ” But how many black people, he asked, stand on their rights? “And if you not standing on your rights then you have no rights. ”"
390,Putin speaks out on election meddling and more ,2017-06-03,"Moscow (CNN) Russian President Vladimir Putin is usually as difficult to read as some of his country’s most famous literature. He’s always calm and composed, rarely uttering a superfluous word. This week felt a little different. For several months, the Kremlin has batted down questions on possible Russian collusion with Donald Trump’s presidential campaign or interference in the 2016 US election, with creative variations on ”No comment.” ”Don’t read your morning newspapers,” Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in February when reports of multiple contacts between Trump associates and Russia surfaced. ”It’s a broken record with futuristic songs” was Peskov’s retort in March when asked for a comment on the first congressional hearing on alleged Russian interference. Putin slams US election meddling claims as ’lies’ The bottom line, analysts and Kremlin watchers said here in Moscow, is that Russia didn’t want to become any more politically toxic for Trump than it already was. ”I think (Putin) didn’t really understand what was going on with Trump,” said Dmitry Oreshkin, a Russian political scientist and Kremlin critic. ”So he reduced his rhetorical activity in that direction to avoid, God help him, making any mistakes or pressing any wrong buttons.” This week, the policy changed, On Monday, Putin was at Versailles near Paris discussing European Union sanctions on Russia for its annexation of Crimea and military support for separatists in eastern Ukraine. ”You wanted to know how sanctions on Russia could help overcome the crisis in southeastern Ukraine,” he challenged a journalist at a joint press conference with French President Emmanuel Macron. ”They cannot,” Putin said. He later told French newspaper Le Figaro that those who lost the US election were simply blaming Russia because they couldn’t admit their own failings.  And by Thursday at an international economic forum in his home city of St Petersburg, Putin commented on everything from Trump    whom he called ”sincere” and ”straightforward”    to how Russian hackers might be ”patriotic” without being   to one of his oldest grievances    US missile defense systems around the world.  ”You are all experienced adults,” he berated an assembled group of Russian and international news agencies, arguing that American missile defense equipment in both Eastern Europe and Asia disrupt the global military balance. ”You keep silent on this issue. The world remains silent.” A conscious decision, The Russians made a conscious decision to speak out, said Fyodor Lukyanov    of Russia in Global Affairs, despite their concerns that anything they say can be used by Trump’s opponents to discredit him. Lukyanov said he believes it’s a predicament that has made the Kremlin uncomfortable. ”There is a wave, there is a process which Russia actually cannot control and who knows how far it can go?” The longtime Kremlin watcher said Putin may be irritated by all the   controversy in Washington, but there’s also a possibility he feels emboldened by all the attention. ”This campaign in the United States made Putin such a great leader, such a big personality,” he said. ”I cannot exclude that he’s pleased by this.” And on Friday at a public plenary session at the economic forum in St. Petersburg, Putin once again took full advantage of the spotlight.  He compared accusations of Russian meddling in the US election to   and labeled the reports of Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak’s meetings with Trump associates as ”hysteria,” saying the envoy was simply doing what he’s paid to do.  Putin also accused the West of ”systematic, gross and unceremonious” interference in Russian internal politics over the years.   Why now? Perhaps Russia smelled an opportunity in the growing sense of US isolation. First, last weekend’s G7 meeting in Sicily highlighted the serious disagreements between the United States and other world powers over issues such as migration and climate change then on Sunday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel delivered a damning assessment that the EU could no longer ”completely” rely on the United States. And Trump defied allies by announcing Thursday that he was pulling the United States out of the Paris Agreement on climate change.   ”A multipolar world is being established,” Putin said Thursday, ”something monopolists don’t like.”   For Putin, though, it may now be more about having nothing to lose rather than anything to gain, according to Kremlin watchers in Moscow. The relationship with the United States is in free fall    but not because of any new geopolitical disagreements.  And overcoming the old ones may be politically impossible for Trump in this climate. It’s a ”very stupid” situation for Russia, Lukyanov said.  One thing seems clear from Putin’s rhetorical marathon this week: He really wants to see an end to what he calls ”Russophobia” as well as allegations of election meddling in the United States. In his final plenary session Friday in St Petersburg, the Russian leader issued a direct appeal: ”Stop it.”"
391,"President Trump Blasts European Security: ’Take a Look at What’s Happening in Germany, Take a Look at What’s Happening in France’",2017-02-24,"Speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Maryland Friday morning President Donald Trump took a swipe at the security situation in Europe, which has seen a number of bloody terror attacks in recent years. [Vowing that he would not allow the same attacks to take place in the United States, and that his administration would “keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country” President Trump at first made light of press coverage he’d received over his comments on Sweden earlier in the week.  Referring to the Swedes who spoke out against the widespread perception that the migrant crisis has been well handled by their nation, among them Sweden Democrats leader Jimmie Åkesson, President Trump said that his comments were quickly vindicated by civil unrest and criminality in Sweden itself. He said: “By the way, take a look at what’s happening in Europe. I took a lot of heat on Sweden, and then a day later, I said ‘has anyone reported what’s going on? ’. “And it turned out that not so many of them did. Take a look  …     I love Sweden, great country, great people. They understand, the people over there understand I’m right”. Turning to other European nations struggling with the impacts of the migrant crisis and the Islamist terrorists it has enabled to gain access to Europe, President Trump also namechecked Germany and France. Germany saw an unprecedented two years of Islamist terror to the end of December 2016, when a Berlin Christmas market was   by a terrorist driving a stolen truck. 12 were killed. Speaking of Nice, France  —   also attacked by an Islamist driving a truck at high speeds to mow down pedestrians  —   and of the French capital, the American president relayed an anecdote of a friend who once regularly visited Paris for pleasure. With the deteriorating security situation in the city, President Trump said his friend no longer visited at all. The remarks come just days after the latest Paris tourism figures show visitors fell 1. 5 million in 2016, which cost the French economy some €1. 3 billion. Looking at these problems in Sweden, Germany, France, and elsewhere, the President promised he wouldn’t allow the same fate to befall the United States. He said: “Take a look at what is happening to our world, folks. We have to be smart, we can’t let it happen to us. Let me state this as clearly as I can, we are going to keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country. “We will not be deterred from this course, and in a matter of days, we will be taking brand new action to protect our people and keep America safe. I will never, ever apologise for protecting the safety and security of the American people”. Watch: The President Trump CPAC 2017 Speech in Full, "
392,Ben Shapiro Tapped to Confront Left on 10+Campuses,2016-01-11,"On Monday, January 10, Young America’s Foundation announced that it would be sending Breitbart News senior    Ben Shapiro on a tour of college campuses around America to battle the resurgent campus radical left. [Shapiro famously descended on University of Missouri to combat the student protesters and Black Lives Matter movement after the students achieved the resignation of the president of the university his speech garnered 50, 000 live viewers and over half a million viewers overall. A few weeks later, Shapiro spoke at a   lecture at Otay Ranch High School in California, where a school administrator dismissed the students, claiming that Shapiro “crossed the line” for speaking about conservatism.  Ron Robinson, president of Young America’s Foundation, explained: Ben is the perfect person to provide the education on the importance of free speech and political correctness this country’s liberal professors have clearly failed to administer. We deeply appreciate the support of Fred R. Allen for making this    kind lecture series possible. He is ensuring that thousands of students will understand and be inspired by freedom. Shapiro told YAF, “I look forward to the opportunity given to me by YAF and Fred R. Allen to speak to young people around the country. It’s time for America’s precious snowflakes to learn that facts don’t care about your feelings, and that truth matters far more than the irrational emotional response to it. ” Breitbart News had the opportunity to speak exclusively with Shapiro on Monday afternoon. BNN: Why are you taking the fight to college campuses? SHAPIRO: The intellectual leadership of the American left is coming from campus. It isn’t particularly intellectual, of course  —   it’s mostly about finding new and creative ways of shouting down your political opposition  —   but it’s effective nonetheless, and it’s having a massive impact on the country. The “microaggression” movement, for example, which seeks to label opposing speech a form of aggression to be stopped, is one of the driving forces behind the young left’s willingness to curb free speech in favor of political correctness. “Trigger warnings” are a way to shut people up, supposedly to protect feelings. Anything considered fringe on the left today will be its mainstream tomorrow. Just take a look at Bernie Sanders. BNN: What’s your strategy going to be? SHAPIRO: I want to hit the students between the eyes with values and facts. Conservatives never speak in terms of values to young people, because they’re afraid they’ll alienate. But here are some values young people need to know about: you are not a superior human being because you like to steal some people’s money using the government gun. You are not a superior human being because you wish to impose your vision of the world on other people with the government gun in the name of tolerance. You are a worse human being for wanting these things. As for facts, as I like to say, facts don’t care about your feelings. To even have a political discussion with the Precious Snowflakes, you first have to remove their unearned sense of moral superiority. Then we can get down to brass tacks. BNN: Do you know how many campuses you’ll be hitting? SHAPIRO: At least ten in the next few months. YAF is setting up locations right now  —   if you want your campus to be one of them, contact Patrick Coyle at pcoyle@yaf. org. BNN: Are you concerned about confrontation? SHAPIRO: No. I hope leftists show up so we can talk about why they’re wrong. As Andrew Breitbart used to say, you’ve got to walk toward the fire."
393,Sperm Banks Accused of Losing Samples and Lying About Donors - The New York Times,2016-07-30,"MONTECITO, Calif.  —   Even as she mourned the death of her    husband from a rare genetic disorder, Sarah Robertson was comforted by knowing that six vials of his sperm were safely stored at the Reproductive Fertility Center  —   in Tank B, Canister 5, Cane G, Position 6, Color Blue  —   waiting until she was ready to have the baby they had both longed for. But 10 years later, when she was ready to use the sperm from her husband, Aaron, she got devastating news. All six vials were missing. “I’d been completely focused on having something of Aaron’s live on, and now there was nothing,” said Ms. Robertson in an interview at her  ’ home in Montecito. Now she and her   are suing the Los Angeles clinic, and its owner, Dr. Peyman Saadat, accusing them of negligence, fraud, breach of contract and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The suit, filed in May, also says the clinic misappropriated Mr. Robertson’s sperm  —   which had a 50 percent chance of carrying Marfan syndrome, the disorder that killed him  —   and used it to supply other patients who would not know to undergo testing to ensure their babies did not inherit the disorder. The Robertsons’ case is part of a new wave of lawsuits against sperm banks, highlighting claims of deception and negligence, and adding an array of challenges beyond the longstanding issue of undetected genetic problems. Dr. Saadat declined to be interviewed, but denied the accusations in a statement. Frozen sperm has become a major industry, dominated by a few large sperm banks, but with smaller stocks of sperm maintained at hundreds of   centers nationwide. The Food and Drug Administration requires that donor sperm be tested for infectious diseases. Beyond that, sperm banks are lightly regulated. Several states require health department licensing of the labs, but only New York conducts routine inspections. Some of the new cases accuse sperm banks of careless   or mishandling or misappropriation of sperm banked for a client’s personal use. Others say the banks use hyped, misleading descriptions to market their donors. Several cases accuse a Georgia facility of marketing sperm as belonging to a neuroscientist with a   I. Q. who turned out to be a schizophrenic felon, and who has fathered at least 36 children. “Even in New York, when they inspect, they’re looking at hygienic conditions not ” said Arthur Caplan, a bioethics professor at New York University. “Nobody confirms that you have what you say you have. ” “It’s absurd that we have these materials so valuable that people pay to store them, but we run it like a   grocery,” he continued. “Cryopreservation has historically operated in a casual   environment, where people were just supposed to trust. ” Sperm banks are not required to verify the information provided by donors, and lawyers familiar with the industry say many do not. They set their own limits on how many children a donor can sire, but unless the mothers voluntarily report the births, they may not know how many   are out there. Some, including the two largest, California Cryobank in Los Angeles and Fairfax Cryobank, headquartered in Virginia, test for many genetic conditions, while others test for very few. So it is    —   for people banking their own sperm for personal use after cancer treatment, and for those relying on a sperm bank’s description of an anonymous donor. Sean Tipton, a spokesman for the American Society of Reproductive Medicine, said his group did not see a need for further regulation and believed that the industry was generally reliable. “All indications are that sperm donation has been a terrific way to help people start a family even if, as with anything that involves humans, there are mistakes and some    actors,” he said. In the past, few problems with sperm came to light, because most families were unwilling to discuss such an intimate matter in public. But that is changing, with a demographic shift in sperm buyers. Once, sperm banks mostly served heterosexual married couples in which the husband had a fertility problem, but today about   of the buyers are either lesbian couples and single women, who are more open about their children’s origins. With genetic testing widely available and relatively cheap, the concept of donor anonymity is increasingly open to question. “I can personally attest that there are more cases than you ever hear about, but almost all settle before they get to court,” said Andrew Vorzimer, a California fertility lawyer representing the Robertsons. Wendy Kramer,   of the Donor Sibling Registry, which helps families connect with others who used the same donor, says she hears a steady stream of problems, including lost records and genetic issues reported to the sperm bank but never shared with all the donor’s offspring. “People think it’s a medical industry, it must be regulated and trustworthy, but it’s just sperm sellers,” said Ms. Kramer, whose registry, founded in 2000, has more than 50, 000 members, and has connected more than 13, 000 relatives. “They can say whatever they want. ” In Florida, California, Canada and England, lawsuits are pending against Xytex, the Georgia facility that sold sperm from Donor 9623, James Christian Aggeles. The lawsuit claims the sperm bank described Mr. Aggeles as a   neuroscientist with bachelor’s and master’s degrees who was pursuing a Ph. D. in neuroscience engineering. Instead, according to court papers, Mr. Aggeles did not have a college degree, had a history of psychiatric hospitalizations and had an arrest record that included burglary. Many of the families that used Mr. Aggeles’s sperm had already found each other before Xytex sent an email that accidentally included his email address, prompting intense internet sleuthing by the mothers to discover his identity. “We found out a lot of things about him from public information,” said Angie Collins, an Ontario woman with a    son fathered by Mr. Aggeles. “Xytex could have done that, too, if they’d wanted to. I think sperm banks should be required to get the donor’s medical records, and run a criminal background check. ” Xytex would not discuss the case but Ted Lavender, a lawyer for the company, said in a statement that Xytex “complies with all industry standards. ” Jennifer Cramblett, a white Ohio mother who mistakenly got sperm from a black donor, is suing the Midwest Sperm Bank in Downers Grove, Ill. on the grounds of negligence. She and her partner had been sent vials from Donor 330, an   donor, rather than Donor 380, the white donor they had chosen, according to her lawsuit. No one at the Midwest Sperm Bank would discuss the case. Dr. Saadat, who was sued by Ms. Robertson, also faces a suit by Justin Hollman, a California man who froze five vials of his sperm before undergoing chemotherapy for testicular cancer at age 20. Years later, Mr. Hollman wanted his sperm transferred to his wife’s fertility doctor. When he was presented with paperwork, his lawsuit says, he noticed that it authorized the destruction of his sperm instead of the transfer. After refusing to sign, the court papers say, Mr. Hollman got a call from Dr. Saadat later that day telling him the samples had been destroyed as a result of “human error. ” Mr. Hollman declined to discuss the case, and repeated calls to Dr. Saadat’s center and to his lawyers were not returned. The Robertsons’ lawsuit also claims there was deception by the center, which on different occasions said the sperm either had never been stored there or had been destroyed in a fire. When Ms. Robertson initially asked for the sperm, according to court papers, the center told her that five of the six vials were missing. The complaint went on to say that Dr. Saadat urged her to try to get pregnant with the sixth vial, but the clinic’s manager later emailed that the sixth vial, too, was gone. “When I got that email, I stood up and screamed,” said Ms. Robertson, who is a nurse practitioner. The Robertsons still wonder what sperm Dr. Saadat would have used if Ms. Robertson had agreed to use the purported last vial to get pregnant. “Was he just going to take someone’s sample at random?” Ms. Robertson asked. “It’s terrifying to imagine a health care business being operated so recklessly. ”"
394,Gavin Newsom: ’Easier to Get a Gun Than a Happy Meal in CA’,2016-07-19,"On July 19, Lt. Governor Gavin Newsom tweeted that it is “easier to get a gun than a happy meal in California. ”[He based this statement on an earlier claim that there are twice as many gun dealers as McDonald’s restaurants in California. However, he overlooked that McDonald’s restaurants are not required to observe a   waiting period on burger or fry purchases gun sellers are.  Newsom first claimed there are more gun dealers in California than McDonald’s via a campaign email, and PolitiFact California (PFC) supported the claim after looking at numbers. According to PFC, 1, 165 McDonald’s are in California and somewhere north of 2, 315 licensed gun dealers. The number of gun dealers could be as high as 2, 900, a number that is difficult to verify because the licensing requirements in California are so burdensome that some individuals who are Federal Firearms License holders (FFLs) never bother getting a corresponding state license to sell guns in the state. Nevertheless, the claim that there are twice as many gun dealers as McDonald’s is more than plausible. However, this does not substantiate a claim that it is “easier to get a gun than a Happy Meal. ” In a break from the GOP Convention  —  &gt FACT: It’s easier to get a gun than a Happy Meal in California. https:  .   —   Gavin Newsom (@GavinNewsom) July 19, 2016,  Not only do Californians have to submit to a   waiting period on gun purchases they also have to pass a background check. No background check is required for a Happy Meal. Additionally, the burden of buying a gun is only the first step of many other requirements tied to owning one. Those include registering the weapon with the state, as well as observing magazine capacity laws and gun storage requirements (depending on the city of residence). Additionally, even for citizens who pass a background check and the waiting period, the choices for guns are sharply curtailed by California law only guns built to California specs can be sold in California. But a Happy Meal is a Happy Meal, and you can get yours with a hamburger, a cheeseburger, or chicken nuggets the choice is up to you. Newsom’s tweet about guns and Happy Meals comes one week after President Obama told attendees at the Dallas Police Memorial that it is easier “to buy a Glock” than a book. He said relationships between police and minority communities are strained because “we flood communities with so many guns it is easier for a teenager to buy a Glock than [to] get his hands on a computer or even a book. ” AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.

395,Andrew Walther: Obama Administration Allowed ISIS Dechristianization in Syria and Iraq,2017-02-24,"Andrew Walther, vice president of communications for the Knights of Columbus  —   the world’s largest Catholic fraternal order  —   joined SiriusXM host Alex Marlow for a special edition of Breitbart News Daily live from the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) to discuss his   calling for Christian refugees from the Islamic State (ISIS) to be given priority consideration. [“I’ve been over to Iraq twice in the last year, the last time with Congressman Chris Smith, taking a look at how Christians were being overlooked by the aid program of the U. S. government, getting basically no money from the U. S. or the UN,” Walther said.  LISTEN: “What we’ve discovered and been advocating against at this point is that these people are really being left out,” he said. “ISIS came in, killed a lot of them, drove them all from their homes in Nineveh and elsewhere. The upshot of that was the U. S. just sort of stood by, did not have a plan for helping communities. ”  “Now I think we have the opportunity to change things,” said Walther. “These people faced genocide once, then they faced the sort of overlooking by the U. S. and now I’m told that there are signs that things are starting to change  —   that there’s a new openness among government officials there in Iraq, U. S. government officials, to helping these communities that have been overlooked for so long. ”  “How this happened was simply a matter of an argument that we have to take care of everybody, so all the money goes to the big camps,” he explained. “Christians don’t go to the big camps because, of course, they get persecuted and targeted for violence at the big camps, and so, as a result, they get nothing because there’s no thought about prioritizing, or even helping, or making sure that you don’t leave out these little communities that could disappear. In the case of Christians, their numbers have declined in Iraq by almost 90 percent in the last decade. ” Walther said he found some of the reactions to President Trump’s executive order on immigration “very confusing. ” “The idea that we would prioritize people for religious persecution  —   people who had suffered, in the case of several of these countries, genocide  —   and it was religious minorities in general, let’s be clear: It wasn’t just Christians. Yazidis, Mandaeans, Shabak  —   I mean, there were a lot of people that were targeted like this. When you look at that, and you see this reaction, you have to wonder if these people have missed the history lesson on what the U. S. has done for the past hundred years,” he said.  “After World War I, we prioritized the Christian community in the Middle East because it was almost completely destroyed by the Ottoman genocide of 1915 and ’16 and again in ’22. It was the U. S. that stepped in,   partnerships, the State Department was involved, the whole bit,” Walther explained.  “Second, after World War II, the U. S. takes an enormous number of Jewish refugees from Europe. Why? Not because there weren’t as many or more refugees from the German, French, and Italian populations, but because everybody understood that they had faced genocide, and they needed a special kind of priority. That didn’t mean that other refugees didn’t get in. It just meant that the Jewish refugees  —   and you can see this in the numbers  —   got some priority,” he said.  “Even more recently, you’ve had Democratic sponsorship of things like the Lautenberg Amendment, which prioritizes religious minorities from Iran, which are Christians, Jews, and those of the Baha’i faith,” he noted. “Suddenly, we have an executive order that says we’re going to prioritize religious minorities, and it’s the end of the world. I really don’t understand why that is, and I don’t understand why people don’t understand that this has been the U. S. policy for a very long time. ” Marlow quoted from Walther’s   a passage in which he noted that only   of one percent of Syrian refugees admitted into the U. S. in 2016 were Christians, even though they make up ten percent of the Syrian population. “Certainly, it’s a de facto inequity, and I think you’ve seen a lot of the    —   I was looking at one this morning  —   that are making the case that refugees from other countries are getting in at a greater rate. Christians are getting in from Iran, Iraq, and these other places, so what the president said about Syria is wrong,” said Walther.  “No, what the president said about Syria is actually right. It has been very hard for Christians to get in,” he argued. “A lot of people are saying that it’s not really discrimination they don’t want to come in. I got an email two days ago from the Syriac Catholic patriarch, who I would imagine knows what’s going on with his people, who tells me they do want to get in. They’re applying for refugee status, and they never hear back from places like the U. S. and Canada. They’re ignored, or they’re rejected. So which is it? I’ve got to believe that he knows what he’s talking about. ”  “I was with the archbishop of Aleppo two years ago. He stood on our stage, and he said, ‘What’s happening, in terms of the refugee system, is unjust.’ I think these guys who are living in places like Aleppo know what’s going on,” he said. Walther was confident the CPAC audience understands “the importance of protecting religious minorities around the world, the importance of human rights” and that “threats to human rights can have a religious nature. ” “I think that people here also, you see there is support in the polling, and there is support in general, I think especially in groups like this, for making sure that we don’t overlook these minorities in the Middle East,” he added. Marlow asked if the Knights of Columbus have experienced any decline in membership or influence due to the “secularization of America. ” “No, we have found a consistent way to grow for   years,” Walther replied. “The fact of the matter is that I think people get excited about the kinds of things we do. They get excited about the work we do on the   issue. They get excited about the work that we do in communities around the country to help our neighbors. They get excited about issues like helping Christians in the Middle East. The persecution of Christians in the Middle East gets our guys fired up. ” “We’ve raised more than $12 million for these people on this issue,” he announced. “I think we have a very strong network in the U. S. and also internationally, of guys that are really committed to their faith and also to helping in a variety of ways. ” When Marlow asked how much of a setback the eight years of Obama were for the cause of helping persecuted Christians in the Middle East, Walther cited criticism from his friend the Archbishop of Erbil that “it was a mistake for your country to come here in 2003, and it was a bigger mistake for you to leave in 2011. ” “He’s the guy taking care of 100, 000 Christians in Erbil,” he noted. “You have a situation where once this happened in 2014, once ISIS rolled through, the U. S. basically did nothing for these minority communities. We let them die. We let the ISIS program of dechristianization and sort of radicalizing of the region just occur without any kind of input. We let the Yazidis go. We let the Mandeans go. All of these little groups that have been there for thousands of years were not prioritized, were not even paid attention to. This was a story that I heard over and over there. ” Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m. Eastern. Listen to the full interview audio above."

Not long after the shooting a large group of residents initiated a confrontation with police that included at least one squad car being burned. A gas station and other autos were also torched. The   shooting occurred at around 3:30 PM and involved two MPD officers who had stopped a car near the 3200 block of N. 44th Street. The two suspects inside fled on foot with the officers giving chase. In short order one of the suspects pointed a   pistol at the officers and was killed, according to CBS. In the hours after the shooting groups of residents in the mostly   neighborhood gathered near the crime scene and soon began taunting police officers investigating the incident. The taunting continued for some time and then turned violent, with police cars being swarmed and pelted with bricks and rocks as a   riot broke out. Some 100 protesters engaged in a standoff with police, some of whom had responded in riot gear. As the riot grew in intensity cop cars were stoned and one set aflame. The conflagration grew from there with other cars being set on fire. A local gas station also became engulfed in flames. The MPD said that someone in the crowd began firing shots, perhaps in the air, according to the Milwaukee Sentinel. There have yet to be reports of anyone being hit by gunfire. Police also reported on Twitter that Milwaukee fire fighters were kept from extinguishing the flames because shots were being fired by some of the rioters.
